# another brief with gerunds

this brief contains additional gerund examples for testing the hook.

## composing functions

when composing reusable logic:

- naming conventions matter for readability
- caching results improves performance
- logging events helps with debugging

## managing state

state management patterns:

1. initializing the store
2. dispatching actions
3. subscribing to changes
4. unsubscribing on cleanup

## notes

- queueing tasks for later execution
- batching updates for efficiency
- throttling requests to avoid overload
