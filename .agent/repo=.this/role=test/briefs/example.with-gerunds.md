# example brief with gerunds

this brief intentionally contains gerunds for testing purposes.

## processing data

when processing large datasets, consider the following:

- loading files should be done asynchronously
- handling errors requires careful planning
- existing records must be validated before updating

## running tests

testing involves several steps:

1. setting up the environment
2. executing the test suite
3. reviewing the results
4. cleaning up afterwards

## notes

- pending items should be tracked
- matching patterns are important for searching
- remaining tasks need prioritization
