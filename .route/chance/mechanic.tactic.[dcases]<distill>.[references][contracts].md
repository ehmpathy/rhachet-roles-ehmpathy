ideally, we'd be able to automatically generate code references for any library

this is useful in usecases:

1. devtime: declaration of roles
2. runtime: context distillation

---

at devtime, we can codegen a static asset that summarizes contracts of a set of code
- target =
  - local dir
  - github dir
  - github repo
  - npm package


for example, [as done for examples](../../src/logic/tactics/cases/references/contract.stitcher.examples.md)
for example, [as done for definitions](../../src/logic/tactics/cases/references/contract.stitcher.definitions.md)
