use a pre-stitch / pre-artifact to think ahead of the execution

that way it has time to reason through its plan before execution

i dont mean pre-route

but just a notepad to do a rough draft / outline / some ideas before hand


---

when?

whenever we're seing subpar results that could be fixed with forethought OR see its writing alot fo forethought above its output

---

alt = allow it to write forethought in one output and just take the last codeblock

---

alt = have it, in one prompt, output two ```md,
- forethought
- result

and send those to two different docs
- we need this capacity separately anyway
