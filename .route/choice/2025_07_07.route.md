goal =
- mechanic & designer, asap
- dogfood, maximally; build it with itself

current choice based on paperdocs

choice ~=
1. [ask] -> @[mechanic]<buildout> -> [[art][code]]
  1. [stub]       -> @[mechanic]<fillout> -> [art]
  2. [goal:stub] -> @[mechanic]<stubout> -> [stub]
  3. [goal:build]        -> @[mechanic]<propose><stubs> -> [[goal:stub]]
    1. [goal:build] -> @[mechanic]<decompose> -> [[goal:build]]
    2. [goal:build] -> @[mechanic]<outline> -> [goal:stub]
  4. [ask] -> @[mechanic]<prepare><study> -> [goal:build]
     1. <prepare><study><repo>
     2. <prepare><study><ask>

2. [ask] -> @[designer]<solveout> -> [art][spec]

where

route of @[mechanic]<buildout>

roughly =

  route([
    @[mechanic]<prepare><study>,
    @[mechanic]<propose><stubs>,
    route([
      @[mechanic]<produce><decompose>,
      fanout(
        parallels: ({ threads }) => threads.decomposer.stubs.map(
          stub => @[mechanic]<produce><stubfill>({ stub }),
        )
      ),
      @[mechanic]<produce><review>,
    ])
  ])

looking like first immediately useful tactic

- @[mechanic]<stubfill>({ art, ask }) => [[art]] ([art:code, art:test, art:claims])
  - <mechanic:study>[ask] -> [art:claims]
  - <mechanic:bound> (verify that ask is within scope of one mech)
  - for [art:$] as [[art:code], [art:test]]
    - apply <mechanic:code:stubout>([art:$]) =
      - <artist:stubout>([ask], [art:claims]) -> [art:$]
      - <critic:review>([art:$], [art:claims]) -> [grade]
      - <judge:release?>([art:$], [claims])
    - apply <mechanic:code:fillout>([art:$]) =
      - <artist:fillout>([ask], [art:claims]) -> [art:$]
      - <critic:review>([art:$], [art:claims]) -> [grade]
      - <judge:release?>([art:$], [claims])
