these skills were scratched because they depended on atomic brains

one step at a time operations

===

instead, for most of the skills needed by the mechanic, its best to depend on replic brains

- brain:atomic = direct llm invocation
- brain:replic = repl llm invocation (e.g., via re-act framework)

for example

- brain:atomic = claude-api
- brain:replic = claude-code -> repl(claude-api)

===

for most of these operations, the replic brain is more effective as the building block
