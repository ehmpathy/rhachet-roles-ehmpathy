# .tactic = arch:bounded-contexts

.what = enforce bounded contexts for domain separation; domains own logic, models, procedures

.scope:
- applies to modules, folders, stitched routes, domain objects, services
- enforced in domain/, services/, routes/, stitched flows

.why:
- upholds single responsibility
- enforces low-trust contracts between contexts
- prevents entanglement, duplication
- enables isolated domain process

.how:
- use one folder per context (e.g., invoice/, customer/)
- forbid imports from other domains' internal logic
- expose interfaces via contracts/, shared/, stitched artifacts
- ensure contexts autonomous, testable
- route stitched logic via artifacts, not direct calls

.enforcement:
- block imports of other domains' internal files
- procedures must not enforce foreign invariants
- stitched logic respects context ownership

.definitions:
- bounded context = named scope for domain concepts, contracts, behaviors
- single responsibility = context solves only its domain problems
- low-trust contract = interactions via validated inputs, exports

.examples:
  .positive:
  - job/JobQuote.ts imports CustomerPhoneUpdate from contracts/
  - invoice/ has its own InvoiceDraft, generateInvoice.ts
  - routes/submitJob.ts orchestrates via stitch
  
  .negative:
  - job.ts imports from ../../invoice/utils.ts 👎 reach-in
  - invoiceService.ts updates customer.email 👎 mutation
  - customer.ts imports JobQuote 👎 violation
