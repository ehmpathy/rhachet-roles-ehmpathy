rule: never allow undefined attributes for domain objects unless database-generated metadata

e.g.:
- ids, createdAt, updatedAt — allowed as metadata, known on read

for all else: explicitly knowable
- if null: set as null and explain why; forbid if no good reason
- otherwise: define exact type

enforcement: blocker level
