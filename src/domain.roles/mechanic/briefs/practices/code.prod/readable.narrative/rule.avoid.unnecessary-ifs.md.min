# extra ifs: extra code branches

avoid ifs maximally

ideal narrative:
- shapes flow fit nicely
- operations apply consistently to shapes

to minimize code paths maximize simplicity

exception: early returns shortcut branches shorten narrative
- e.g., in IFFEs
- e.g., in operations

avoid ifs creating logical branches
