### .tactic = codestyle:single-responsibility

#### .what
enforce single responsibility for every code file and procedure

#### .why
- easier to locate, understand, test code
- separates concerns: logic, validation, orchestration
- prevents file bloat with unrelated logic

#### .rules

👍 required
- each file exports exactly one named procedure
- filename matches exported procedure
- all logic supports procedure's domain intent
- runtime typechecks only if file's purpose is validation

👎 forbidden
- more than one exported procedure per file
- co-located validation, parse, or orchestration with domain logic
- runtime type assertions in general-purpose logic
- dead code, TODOs, unrelated comments
- redundant runtime typechecks

#### .examples

**👍 good**
```ts
// getCustomerInvoices.ts
/**
 * .what = retrieves all invoices for a given customer
 * .why = isolates domain logic for invoice lookup
 */
export const getCustomerInvoices = ({ customerId }: { customerId: string }) => {
  return invoiceDao.findMany({ customerId });
};
```

**👎 bad**
```ts
// customerUtils.ts
export const getCustomerInvoices = (...) => { ... }

export const validateCustomer = (...) => { ... }  // 👎 multiple responsibilities
```
