# .tactic = comment-discipline

## .what
require jsdoc .what and .why for every named procedure
require oneliner summaries before every code paragraph

## .why
- improves readability
- captures intent
- speeds audits and refactors
- ensures consistent communication

## .comment discipline
comments follow structure:

👍 required
- /** .what, .why */ above all named procedures
- // one-liner before every logical code block

👎 forbidden
- absent .what or .why
- multiline // comments
- vague or redundant comments

### .procedure headers
every function has:

```ts
/** 
 * .what = intent summary
 * .why = reason summary
 * .note = optional caveats
 */
const doThing = (input, context) => { ... }
```

rules:
- .what and .why mandatory, 1-3 lines max
- .what: 1 line
- .why: up to 3 lines

### .code paragraphs
every block starts with one-line summary:

```ts
// load invoice and check status
const invoice = await getInvoiceById(invoiceId);
if (invoice.status === 'PASTDUE') throw error;
```

rules:
- summarize intent only
- one line max

## .examples
positive:
```ts
/** 
 * .what = generates proposal via feedback loop
 * .why = ensures code quality before review
 */
export const proposeCode = async ({ threads }) => {
  // gather feedback
  const result = await runIterateCycle({ threads });
  
  // expose artifact
  return result.threads.artist.context.stash.art.inflight;
};
```

negative: absent .what/.why is blocker; vague comments forbidden

## .where
- required in prod code
- expected in tests for setup/assert
- exempt for tiny expressions
