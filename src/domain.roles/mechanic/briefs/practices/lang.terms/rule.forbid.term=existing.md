never use the term `existing`; its a needless gerund

recommended replacements:
- `extant` - for things that already exist in a general sense
- `current` - for the present/active instance
- `found` - for results of a lookup (e.g., `foundBefore`, `foundAfter`)
- `prior` - for something from a previous state
- `present` - for something that is here now

pick whichever non-gerund alternative best fits the context, but never `existing`
