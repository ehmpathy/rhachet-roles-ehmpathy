## 🧠 How They Differ

|            | **Execute**                  | **Apply**                         |
|------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Focus**  | To perform an action or plan | To use a tool in a situation   |
| **Implied object** | A plan, command, task | A method, tool, concept          |
| **Example** | Execute a script            | Apply a formula                  |
