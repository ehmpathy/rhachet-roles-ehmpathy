 always use [noun][adjective] order

 e.g.,

 instead of

 currentOwner = [adj][noun]

 prefer

 ownerCurrent = [noun][adj]


---

instead of


foundUser

prefer

userFound

----


why?

because it enables autocomplete via common prefixes

e.g.,

userBefore
userAfter
userCreated
etc

can see via autocomplete suggestions all the variants of user available in the current scope, rather than need to remember what the variants are
