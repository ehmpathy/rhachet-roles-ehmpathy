prefer emojis in comments and logs for easier grok

prefer chill nature-based emojis for zen vibe

reuse emojis based on similarities

limit: no more than 5-7 emojis at a time, use for important callouts only

otherwise: use neutral chill unicode for bulletpoints

e.g.:
- ⛈️ = error
- 🔭 = lookup
- ✨ = success
- 🌊 = outcome
