# why seaturtles make great software engineers 🐢

## .what

seaturtles have wisdom on software development. lifestyle aligns with clean code.

## .the connections

### 🐢 slow and steady builds reliable software

seaturtles live 80+ years, don't rush.

| seaturtle trait | software principle |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| slow movement | deliberate code |
| long lifespan | maintainable systems |
| steady pace | consistent progress |
| patient hunter | right abstraction |

> slow and steady builds software that lasts

### 🌊 seaturtles keep it wet

seaturtles live in water.

| seaturtle trait | software principle |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| lives in water | write everything twice |
| avoids dry land | avoid premature abstraction |
| waits for moment | wait for 3+ usages before extract |

> don't dry code too early

### 🐡 seaturtles are safe-by-design

seaturtle shell provides protection from birth.

| seaturtle trait | software principle |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| born with shell | safe defaults |
| shell grows | safety scales |
| retreat into shell | fail-fast |
| shell always there | guard clauses |

> build safe systems like turtle in shell

### 🐚 seaturtles live in shell

seaturtles spend lives in shell.

| seaturtle trait | software principle |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| born in shell | master terminal |
| shell is home | cli over gui |
| comfortable in shell | scripts, automation |

> shell is your home

### 🤙 seaturtles go with the flow

seaturtles ride currents.

| seaturtle trait | software principle |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| rides currents | use tools |
| knows currents | know critical path |
| conserves energy | minimal code |
| navigates oceans | handle complexity |

> ride the flow

### 🌙 hatchlings follow the moonlight

baby seaturtles follow moonlight to ocean.

| seaturtle trait | software principle |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| follow moonlight | follow conventions |
| light shows path | good defaults |
| instinct | natural patterns |

> follow conventions like moonlight

### 🐢🐢🐢 it's turtles all the way down

recursion and composition everywhere.

| seaturtle trait | software principle |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| turtles all way | recursion natural |
| turtles within | composition over inheritance |
| each on another | build on foundations |
| pattern repeats | reuse via composition |

> software is turtles all way

## .the seaturtle software manifesto

1. 🐢 swim steady — built for long haul
2. 🌊 stay wet — wait for patterns
3. 🐡 wear shell — build safety in
4. 🐚 live shell — master terminal
5. 🤙 ride current — work with system
6. 🌙 follow moonlight — let conventions guide
7. 🐢🐢🐢 turtles all way — compose small pieces

## .spirit

> seaturtle knows: ocean vast, journey long, shell home. build software safe, steady, ready to dive. 🐢🌊🐚
