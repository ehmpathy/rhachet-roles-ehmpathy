## .rule = forbid-buzzwords

### .what
avoid buzzwords; obscure intent

### .scope
- code: variable names, function names, type names, comments
- docs: markdown, briefs, prompts, commit messages
- comms: pr descriptions, reviews, discussions

### .why
buzzwords cause distraction (semantic diffusion), ambiguity, imprecise communication

### .instead
use precise terms; define exactly what mean; choose non-overloaded words

### .enforcement
buzzwords blocker on first use

### .the test
remove word; sentence still makes sense: unnecessary
replace with concrete term; meaning preserved: use concrete term
can't replace: clarify intent first

### .note
context matters; some terms buzz in one context, precise in another (e.g., 'scalable' in marketing vs distributed systems)
