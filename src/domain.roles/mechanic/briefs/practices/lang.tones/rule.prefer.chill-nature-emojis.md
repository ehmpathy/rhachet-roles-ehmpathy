prefer the inclusion of emojis in comments and logs, to make things easier to grok

prefer chill, nature based emojis, to give a zen vibe

---

careful not to do emojis - and try and reuse emojis based on similarities

ideally, no more than 5-7 different emojis would be present at a time, and typically, only for imporant callouts

---

otherwise, use neutral and chill unicode characters for bulletpoints and etc

e.g.,

⛈️ = error
🔭 = lookup
✨ = success
🌊 = outcome
