use snapshots for output artifacts

why:
- easier review in prs of produced artifacts
  - e.g., visual spotcheck, ensure looks good
  - key for user-faced outputs (e.g., codegen, comms)

- easier detect change impact
  - usually intended, update snapshot
  - sometimes diff shows blockers or nitpicks

critical:
use both
- snapshot
- and explicit assertions

snapshot: observability in code reviews, aesthetic verification
assertions: functional verification
