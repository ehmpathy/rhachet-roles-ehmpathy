.what = use terraform instead of adhoc shell commands for infra

.why:
  - declarative:
    - declare desires, compare reality
    - simpler review: see final product in code
    - detect divergence with reality
    - enable drift detection
    - more

if goal change infra (add, del, set resources) => use terraform

note: code.actors ease terraform state sync && go from wish => criteria => done
