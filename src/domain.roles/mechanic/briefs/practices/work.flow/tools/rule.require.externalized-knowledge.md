if you use a tool dependency that is not already fully understood with internalized knowledge

first, it is mandatory to externalize knowledge about that tool

for example
- what is it
- when was it released
- how much does it cost
- how to use it

- what are advantages and devantages? boons and banes?

research this always via a websearch first

and always cite your sources
