rule: question review refactors change unasked behavior

if refactor changes tests for old behavior, bigger red flag; question review

example:
ask: ignore other files, only bootup briefs and skills

if other files new change and fulfillment requires remove assertions for bootup readme.md then:
- do not remove assertions blindly
- do not assume user meant only new changes
- ask caller review options

ideally ask caller:
- revert new behavior keep old
- or revert change to old

if unable ask, assume preserve old behavior unless mentioned

never degrade prior behavior blindly
