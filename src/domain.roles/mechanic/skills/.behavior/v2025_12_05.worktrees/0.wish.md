wish = could easily work on the same repo in parallel on local machine

specifically, e.g.,
1. create worktrees per branch (find or create by branch name)

with requirements
- worktrees should not be nested within the repo itself
  - i.e., vscode's git diff viewer should not show those worktrees
- worktrees should be listable, gettable, settable from the root repo
  - git.worktree.set vlad/practs => findserts a worktree at `@gitroot/../_worktrees/$reponame/vlad.practs`
    - git.worktree.set vlad/practs --open => finderts && then runs `codium $path` to open the repo at that path
    - git.worktree.set vlad/practs --main => ensures the worktree is created from origin/main, not from current branch
  - git.worktree.del vlad/practs => removes the worktree at `@gitroot/../_worktrees/$reponame/vlad.practs`
  - git.worktree.get => lists all the worktrees for this `@gitroot/../_worktrees/$reponame`

- worktrees should be listable, gettable, settable from other worktrees too
  - the same exact operations should be supported
  - the path of the worktree's for the repo should be carefully determined
    - -> so that worktrees created from root repo and worktrees of repo are written to same dir
    - i.e.,
      - if @gitroot of current repo has `_worktrees` in the path, we know its a worktree, so reuse `/.../_worktrees/$reponame` as the `$REPO_WORKTREES_DIR`
      - if @gitroot of current repo does not have `_worktrees` in the path, we know its not -> compute via `@gitroot/../_worktrees/$reponame` as the `$REPO_WORKTREES_DIR`

---

ideally, we'd have test coverage on these operations too
