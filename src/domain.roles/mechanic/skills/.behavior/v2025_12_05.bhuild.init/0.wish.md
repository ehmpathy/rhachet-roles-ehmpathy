wish =

could execute a skill called `init.bhuild.sh`


(emit it into src/roles/mechanic/.skills/init.bhuild.sh)


which would provision a `.behavior/v${isodate}.${behaviorname}` dir in the $pwd
  - $isodate of format 2025_11_07
  - $behaviorname = input from terminal (via --name)

within that dir, $BEHAVIOR_DIR, would have the following files

`$BEHAVIOR_DIR/0.wish.md`

    ```md
    wish =

`$BEHAVIOR_DIR/3.1.research.domain._.v1.src`

    ```md
    research the domain available in order to fulfill the wish declared
    in $BEHAVIOR_DIR/0.wish.md

    specifically
    - what are the domain objects that are involved with this wish
      - entities
      - events
      - literals
    - what are the domain operations
      - getOne
      - getAll
      - setCreate
      - setUpdate
      - setDelete
      - ...

    - given the research declared here $BEHAVIOR_DIR/3.1.research.domain._.v1.i1.md

    procedure
    1. declare the usecases and envision the contract that would be used to fulfill the usecases
    2. declare the domain.objects, domain.operations, and access.daos that would fulfill this, via the declastruct pattern in this repo
