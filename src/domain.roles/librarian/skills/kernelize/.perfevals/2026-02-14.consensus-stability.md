## summary

| brief | consensus runs | threshold | attempts | jaccard | kernel counts |
|-------|----------------|-----------|----------|---------|---------------|
| input-context-pattern | 3 | 0.5 | 3 | 100% | 19, 18, 19 |
| dependency-injection | 3 | 0.5 | 3 | 86% | 17, 14, 15 |
| forbid-gerunds | 3 | 0.5 | 3 | 31% | 0, 17, 20 |
| arrow-only | 3 | 0.5 | 3 | 100% | 13, 13, 13 |

## interpretation

- **consensus runs** = how many extractions per consensus call
- **threshold** = fraction of runs a kernel must appear in
- **attempts** = how many times we ran consensus
- **jaccard** = overlap via brain-driven semantic cluster (target >80%)

## overall

- mean jaccard: 79.3%
- briefs evaluated: 4
