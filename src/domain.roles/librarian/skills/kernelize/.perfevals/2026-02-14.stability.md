## interpretation

- **clusters** = total distinct concepts found via brain-driven semantic cluster
- **full coverage** = clusters that appeared in ALL runs (most stable)
- **mean coverage** = average % of runs each cluster appeared in
- **target** = full coverage ratio >80%

## overall

- full coverage ratio (mean): 68.0%
- mean coverage (mean): 86.4%
- briefs evaluated: 7
- briefs with errors: 1
