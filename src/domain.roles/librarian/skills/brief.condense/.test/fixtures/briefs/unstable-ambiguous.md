### .note = various considerations

things to think about:
- stuff matters
- quality is important
- do the right thing
- consider the context
- it depends on the situation

sometimes you should do X, other times Y. it varies.

maybe use approach A? or B could work too. both have tradeoffs.

the answer is: it depends.

general principles:
- be good
- avoid bad things
- use best practices (whatever those are)
- follow standards (unspecified)
- optimize for success

when in doubt, think about it more. or ask someone. or just try something and see what happens.
