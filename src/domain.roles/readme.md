# 🐢 ehmpathy role registry

this registry defines four core roles used to craft empathetic, evolvable, and maintainable software.

each role is a lens — a way to think about the system — grounded in empathy for both the **people who use the product** and the **engineers who maintain the system**.

all roles maximize:

- clarity over cleverness
- maintainability over magic
- empathy over ego
