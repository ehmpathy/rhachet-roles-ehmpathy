wish =

that the nudge permissions were reported bettter
by src/logic/roles/mechanic/.skills/claude.hooks/check.pretooluse.permissions.sh

specifically, claude/settings.local.json uses the `:*` pattern for wildcard representation

but when we report that as an option to use w/ claude-code

claude code confuses it to mean literally `:`

e.g.,

when

`npm run build:*` is in the permissions allowlist

and the nudge tells it that

claude-code then tries to run

`npm run build:ts` , even though it should have ran `npm run build` directly

it dosen't think it has the ability to run `npm run build`

---

same with

`cat:*`

it tries to run

`cat: xyz`, which then fails

---

lets update the report to make it clear that `:*` means a wildcard, not literal `:`
