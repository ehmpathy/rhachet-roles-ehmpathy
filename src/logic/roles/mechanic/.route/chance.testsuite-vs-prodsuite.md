worked pretty closely!

the only diff was in some prethought required, e.g.,

1. what are reusable?
2. what are relevant usecases?

maybe write.testsuite is diff to write.prodsuite


cause ideally for the below example, it would have prethought and known that context was reusable in both cases

woulda been cool to review the stubout of test cases it wants to write first too, and tune that before apply

      ```sh

      ➜ npx rhachet ask -r mechanic -s write \
              -t src/logic/artifact/genStepSwapArtifact.test.ts \
              --references src/logic/artifact/genStepSwapArtifact.ts,src/logic/artifact/genStepArtSet.integration.test.ts \
              --ask "

              create a test suite for genStepSwapArtifact. look at the referenced declaration of genStepSwapArtifact to think through the desired test cases. look at the referenced genStepArtSet.integration.test.ts to see the pattern for how to write tests
