we need to be very skeptical of nullable attributes

there needs to be a clear domain reason for why an attribute can be null - and it should be clearly articulated

if there's no clear reason to support it as null, ensure the attribute has a clear type declared

rational or its forbidden

this is a BLOCKER level violation
