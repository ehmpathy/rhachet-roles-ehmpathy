# .brief: focal.breadth

## what

**focal.breadth** refers to the **field of view** (FoV) — the angular or spatial extent of the scene captured by the lens. It defines *how much* of the world is included in the frame, horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

The term "breadth" is used here as a conceptual synonym for FoV: a lens’s **focal.breadth** determines the spatial span visible at any moment of focus.

## why

**focal.breadth** governs spatial inclusion:
- Wide breadth = broader context, more environment, less magnification
- Narrow breadth = tighter crop, more subject isolation, stronger compression

This impacts:
- **Composition and storytelling**
- **Spatial relationships** (e.g. background flattening)
- **Perceptual distance** between foreground and background elements

## governed by

### 📐 Lens-to-sensor geometry

\`\`\`
focal.breadth ∝ k₁ / f
\`\`\`

Where:
- `k₁` = `sensor_size` = physical diagonal of the camera sensor
- `f` = `focal_length` = optical focal length of the lens

> Shorter focal lengths → **wider breadth**
> Longer focal lengths → **narrower breadth**

## key behaviors

| Adjustment             | Effect on focal.breadth         |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Decrease focal length  | expands breadth (wide angle)     |
| Increase focal length  | narrows breadth (telephoto)      |
| Crop sensor vs full-frame | reduces breadth (less of scene) |

---

## creative usage

- **Wide focal.breadth** (e.g. 24mm):
  - Landscape, architecture, immersive scenes
  - Emphasizes environment over subject

- **Narrow focal.breadth** (e.g. 85mm+):
  - Portraits, wildlife, compressed compositions
  - Emphasizes subject, de-emphasizes context

---

## limitations

- Very wide breadths may introduce distortion at frame edges
- Very narrow breadths reduce spatial awareness and require greater stability
- Breadth must be balanced with focal.acuity and focal.depth to maintain clarity across the frame

---

## metaphorical phrasing

> **focal.breadth** is your **window onto the world**
> It defines *how wide the camera can see* — the lateral span of your visual attention.
