# .brief: focal.detail

## what

**focal.detail** refers to the **fineness of structure** that can be resolved **at the focal plane** â€” the surface where objects are in perfect optical focus. It determines the **granularity** of detail captured in the sharpest part of the image.

Also called **resolving power**, **focal.detail** governs how crisp textures, edges, and microstructures appear when in focus.

---

## why

While **focal.depth** determines *how much* of the scene appears in focus, **focal.detail** determines *how sharply* the in-focus region is rendered.

Itâ€™s critical for:
- Revealing texture and microcontrast
- Supporting high-resolution output
- Achieving clinical sharpness in product, macro, or technical photography

## governed by

### ðŸ”¬ Diffraction-limited grain size

\[
\text{grain} = d = 2.44 \cdot \lambda \cdot N
\]

Where:
- \( d \) = diffraction blur diameter (minimum resolvable detail)
- \( \lambda \) = wavelength of light (â‰ˆâ€¯550â€¯nm for green)
- \( N \) = aperture (f-number)

> focal.detail **decreases** (grain size increases) with:
> - smaller aperture (larger f-number)
> - longer wavelengths (e.g. redder light)

## key behaviors

| Adjustment         | Effect on focal.detail       |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| Larger aperture (â†“f-number) | increases it (finer grain)     |
| Smaller aperture (â†‘f-number) | decreases it (coarser grain via diffraction) |
| Shorter wavelength (e.g. blue light) | increases it (sharper grain)         |
| Better lens/sensor quality | improves it at all apertures    |

---

## creative usage

- **Maximized focal.detail** (e.g. f/2.8 or f/5.6):
  - Razor-sharp subjects with rich texture
  - Used in product, studio, macro, and fine art photography

- **Intentionally softened focal.detail** (e.g. f/22):
  - Used for dreamy, diffuse rendering
  - Or to prioritize **focal.depth** when scene-wide clarity is required

---

## limitations

- **focal.detail** is limited by **diffraction** at small apertures
- Gains in detail come at the cost of reduced **focal.depth**
- Sensor resolution cannot recover lost optical detail

---

## metaphorical phrasing

> focal.detail is your **sharpness budget**
> It defines how finely your lens can **draw the truth** at the point of focus
