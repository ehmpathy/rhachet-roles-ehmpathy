# .brief: focal.triad

## what

The **focal.triad** describes the core physical relationship between:

- **focal.depth** — the range of distances that appear acceptably sharp
- **focal.detail** — the grain of fine structure resolvable at the focal plane
- **focal.distance** — the distance from the lens to the subject being focused on

These three are bound by optical constraints: **increasing one often requires decreasing another**. The triad captures this tension in a single proportional relationship.

## equation

Assuming constant lens and sensor configuration:

> focal.depth ~= focal.detail * focal.distance^2
> focal.depth ≈ focal.detail × (focal.distance)²

This means:

> You can increase focal.depth by either:
> - focusing farther away (↑ focal.distance)
> - accepting coarser detail (↑ focal.detail)

Conversely:

> To maximize focal.detail (sharpest grain), you must reduce focal.depth or focus closer.

## why it matters

The **focal.triad** governs key photographic tradeoffs:

| Variable         | Increase it by…                       | But at the cost of…                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| focal.depth      | smaller aperture, farther subject      | reduced focal.detail                    |
| focal.detail     | wider aperture                        | shallower focal.depth                   |
| focal.distance   | stepping back                         | deeper focal.depth, flatter composition |

## key principle

> The **focal.triad** is a balance of *where* you focus, *how much* is in focus, and *how finely* it's resolved.
> **You can't maximize all three** at once.

## visual metaphor

- **focal.detail** — how finely your lens can draw
- **focal.depth** — how far your sharpness reaches
- **focal.distance** — where you aim your attention

Together, they form a **dynamic triangle**: adjust one, and the others must shift.

## tradeoff examples


> focal.depth ≈ focal.detail × (focal.distance)²

focal.depth / focal.detail = focal.distance

so, 1 / focal.detail = focal.distance

so, to decrease detail, we must increase distnace?


want to get smaller details? (focal.detail--)
either
- get closer away (focal.distance--)
- get narrower context (focal.depth--)

want to get broader depth? (focal.depth++)
either
- get further away (focal.distance++)
- get larger details (focal.detail++)

want to get closer? (focal.distance--)
either
- get narrower context (focal.depth--)
- get smaller details (focal.detail--)
