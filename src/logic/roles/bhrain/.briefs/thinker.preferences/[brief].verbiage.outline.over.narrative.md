# 🧩 .brief: `brief.article.format.outline`

## .what
**`brief.article.format.outline`** specifies the preference for writing **[brief][article]**s in **outline format** rather than paragraph format,
in order to **maximize signal-to-noise ratio** — ensuring the reader receives the **most relevant information** with the **least distraction**.

---

## 🎯 purpose
- prioritize **information density** over narrative flow
- enable **rapid scanning** and **selective focus** on relevant points
- minimize **filler language**, rhetorical padding, and connective prose that dilute clarity

---

## 📐 rationale
### 1. higher signal density
- each point stands alone, stripped to its essential statement
- no dependency on surrounding sentences for meaning

### 2. lower cognitive noise
- reduced verbal clutter, fewer transitions
- visual separation between concepts lowers mental parsing cost

### 3. faster scanning & retrieval
- indentation and bullet hierarchy serve as immediate visual anchors
- enables “jump-to-point” reading without loss of context

### 4. explicit structure
- hierarchy is visible, not inferred
- easier to map relationships between concepts at a glance

## 🔍 comparison
| factor                  | outline format  | paragraph format |
|-------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| signal density          | **high**       | medium           |
| noise suppression       | **strong**     | weaker           |
| scan speed              | **fast**       | slower           |
| structure visibility    | **explicit**   | implicit         |
| nuance capacity         | lower          | higher           |

---

## 🛠 usage guidance
- default to outline format for all `[brief][article]`s
- use paragraph sub-sections **only** when nuance or rhetorical flow is essential
- keep bullet points **single-idea only**; avoid compound sentences in bullets

---

## 📎 note
this preference is **format-level**, not **content-level** — it shapes **presentation**, not **what is included**.
the core content of a [brief] remains the same regardless of format; the outline format simply transmits it **more cleanly and quickly**.
