# 🧩 .brief.lesson: howto create a .brief.demo via example

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to create a `.brief.demo`, a concise document that demonstrates a concept through a specific example, with a focus on instantiating the concept in a dedicated “What” section to make it clear and tangible.

## 📋 Steps

1. **Define the Concept Clearly**
   - Write a brief, one-sentence definition of the concept to set the context for the demonstration.
   - **Example**: For the concept of a use case, define it as “A use case describes how a user interacts with a system to achieve a goal, detailing actors, steps, and system responses.”
2. **Choose a Representative Example**
   - Select a single, concrete example that directly embodies the concept and is relatable to the audience.
   - **Example**: For shear force, choose “scissors cutting paper” to show parallel forces causing material deformation, a clear and familiar instance.
3. **Instantiate the Concept in the “What” Section**
   - Present the example as a direct instance of the concept, using a structure that mirrors its natural form (e.g., a use case template for “Booking a Flight,” a scenario for shear force).
   - Avoid general descriptions; focus on showing the concept in action.
   - **Example**: For a use case, present a structured description with Actor (Traveler), Goal (purchase a ticket), Main Flow (search, select, pay), and Exceptions (no flights, payment failure).
4. **Explain the Connection in a “How” Section**
   - Detail how the example embodies the concept’s key characteristics, using a structured format like a bulleted list to ensure clarity and depth.
   - **Example**: For “Booking a Flight,” explain how its structured flow and exception handling align with a use case’s role in defining system requirements.

## 🔑 Key Considerations

- **Instantiation is Key**: The “What” section should always present the example as an instance of the concept (e.g., a use case template, not just a booking process) to directly demonstrate its essence, making the concept tangible.
- **Keep It Concise**: Avoid verbose outlines or excessive sub-bullets; focus on the example’s core elements to maintain clarity, as seen in the streamlined “Booking a Flight” use case.
- **Adapt to Concept Type**: Tailor the instantiation to the concept’s nature—use templates for meta-concepts (e.g., use case), scenarios for physical concepts (e.g., shear force), or specific items for tangible concepts (e.g., Darjeeling tea).
- **Ensure Relatability**: Choose examples that resonate with the audience (e.g., scissors for shear force, a familiar website for booking), ensuring accessibility across technical or abstract concepts.
