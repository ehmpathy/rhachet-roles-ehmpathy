# ðŸ§© .brief.demo: `walkability` â€” low-walkability suburb scenario

## scenario
picture a suburban cul-de-sac development outside a major city.

- **distance**: the nearest grocery store and school are 2â€“3 miles away.
- **street layout**: long, winding roads with no direct pedestrian shortcuts.
- **sidewalks**: often absent, or discontinuous, forcing pedestrians to walk on the road shoulder.
- **safety**: cars travel at high speeds on arterial roads, with few marked crosswalks.
- **aesthetics**: large parking lots and blank building facades dominate the landscape.

## demonstration
a resident wants to pick up a gallon of milk.
- walking would take nearly an hour along unsafe, shoulder-only roads.
- there are no benches, shade trees, or safe crossings along the way.
- instead, the resident drives **5 minutes** by car to the supermarket, as walking feels impractical and unsafe.

## why this demonstrates *low* walkability
- **inconvenience**: daily needs are only reachable by car.
- **unsafe**: lack of pedestrian infrastructure deters walking.
- **unpleasant**: the built environment discourages walking as an option.
- **isolating**: fewer spontaneous social encounters occur compared to walkable areas.
