# ðŸ§© .brief: `catalogize perspective and divergence`

## .what

`<catalogize>` is a focus.motion primitive for organizing and generating a structured catalog of concepts or entities. It operates by systematically exploring and mapping distinct aspects or components of the core concept, producing a comprehensive and organized output.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ purpose

- organize concepts into a coherent, navigable structure
- reveal hidden patterns or relationships among concepts
- provide a detailed overview or inventory of related elements

---

## ðŸŒ¿ relation to divergence

- **similarity with `<diverge>`:** both expand a core concept to surface variations and alternatives.
- **difference from `<diverge>`:** `<catalogize>` focuses on organizing the expanded output, while `<diverge>` focuses on generating diverse possibilities.

> `<diverge>` proposes; `<catalogize>` organizes and solidifies the proposition into a catalog.

---

## ðŸ“œ method

1. **preparation**
   - Optional: Perform `<diverge>` to gather a wide array of possibilities related to the core concept.
   
2. **focus configuration**
   - Input: Define the `focus.concept` to set the scope and anchor of the catalogization.
   
3. **execute catalogize**
   - Structure: Categorize components of the concept by grouping them into logical categories or lists.
   - Label: Assign labels or tags to segments for clarity and easy reference.
   
4. **finalize**
   - Verification: Ensure all important components are included and well-organized.
   - Optimization: Refine the structure for clarity and ease of navigation.

## ðŸ’¬ in practice

Using `<catalogize>` after `<diverge>` enhances efficiency. By preparing a diverse array of concept variations in advance, `<catalogize>` can focus more on organizing and detailed catalog construction, rather than generating raw content.

## ðŸ§  examples

### Scenario: Product Feature Catalog
- **Input:** Outputs from `<diverge>` including various feature ideas.
- **Use `<catalogize>` to:**
  - Group features into functionality categories (e.g., "User Experience," "Security," "Performance").
  - Create an inventory of planned features for development teams and stakeholders.

### Scenario: Research Findings Catalog
- **Input:** Data points and hypotheses from your research.
- **Use `<catalogize>` to:**
  - Organize findings into thematic areas or trends.
  - Label each area with key insights or questions for further exploration.
