# ðŸ§© .brief.demo: `walkability` â€” school commute scenario

## scenario
consider a city district where children can safely walk to school.

- **distance**: most homes are within a 10â€“15 minute walk of the school.
- **path quality**: sidewalks are continuous, with curb ramps for strollers and wheelchairs.
- **safety measures**: crossing guards are present at busy intersections; speed limits are enforced in school zones.
- **comfort**: tree canopies provide shade, and there are benches every few blocks for rest.

## demonstration
each morning, groups of children walk to school together.
- parents feel comfortable letting older children walk independently.
- children encounter classmates along the way, turning the commute into a social activity.
- the presence of other walkers creates a sense of safety and community.

## why this demonstrates walkability
- **accessibility**: essential destinations (schools) are reachable on foot.
- **safety**: traffic design and pedestrian support reduce risk.
- **community fabric**: daily walking builds social ties among families.
- **health benefit**: routine walking encourages exercise as part of everyday life.
