# ðŸ§© .brief.demo: `walkability` â€” tourism & leisure scenario

## scenario
imagine a historic downtown district designed for pedestrians.

- **density**: museums, cafes, shops, and theaters are clustered within a compact area.
- **pedestrian priority**: car traffic is limited or slowed by cobblestone streets and bollards.
- **navigation**: clear signage points to attractions, restrooms, and public transport hubs.
- **comfort**: public plazas, shaded promenades, and fountains provide natural stopping points.

## demonstration
a group of tourists spends an afternoon exploring:
- they walk from their hotel to a museum in **7 minutes**, then continue another **4 minutes** to a cafÃ© for lunch.
- afterward, they stroll through a park and reach the central square for evening performances, all without needing a car.
- the entire experience feels seamless, safe, and enjoyable.

## why this demonstrates walkability
- **access**: attractions are clustered and reachable on foot.
- **safety & comfort**: pedestrian-first design makes walking appealing.
- **experience**: walking becomes part of the leisure activity, not just transportation.
- **economic vitality**: businesses thrive because foot traffic naturally brings customers.
