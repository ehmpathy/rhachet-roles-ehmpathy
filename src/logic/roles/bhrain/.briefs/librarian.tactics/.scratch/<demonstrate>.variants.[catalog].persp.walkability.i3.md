# ðŸŒ³ semantic lattice of concept-demos (cluster view + guiding questions + examples)


\`\`\`
concept demonstration (demo, genus)
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ instance
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ example
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ question: "what counts as it?"
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ example: "downtown portland is highly walkable â€”
â”‚   â”‚              groceries, schools, and cafes within 10 minutes."
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ counter
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ question: "what is it not?"
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ example: "los angeles suburbs where every errand
â”‚   â”‚              requires a car â€” this is not walkability."
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ contrast
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ question: "how is this different from that?"
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ example: "compare downtown portland (walkable) to
â”‚   â”‚              houston sprawl (car-dependent)."
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ gradation
â”‚       â†³ question: "how does it vary along a spectrum?"
â”‚       â†³ example: "low â†’ medium â†’ high walkability across three block patterns."
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ medium
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ visual
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ question: "what does it look like?"
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ example: "map sketch with a house at the center,
â”‚   â”‚              icons for grocery, school, cafÃ©,
â”‚   â”‚              all within a shaded 10-minute radius."
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ emotional
â”‚       â†³ question: "what does it feel like?"
â”‚       â†³ example: "the calm of strolling to a cafÃ© vs the stress of sitting in traffic."
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ transfer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analogy
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ question: "what is it like, in structure?"
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ example: "walkability is like a circulatory system:
â”‚   â”‚              sidewalks are arteries, intersections are valves,
â”‚   â”‚              parks are lungs, stores are nutrients."
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ metaphor
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ question: "what is it, figuratively?"
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ example: "walkability is oxygen for a city."
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ simile
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ question: "what is it like, figuratively?"
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ example: "a walkable neighborhood feels like a living room â€”
â”‚   â”‚              everything close, familiar, and reachable."
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ allegory
â”‚       â†³ question: "what story-world can stand in for it?"
â”‚       â†³ example: "a city without walkability is a kingdom without paths:
â”‚                  villages isolated, markets starved, citizens trapped.
â”‚                  when paths connect, culture and trade flow."
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ sequence
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ walkthrough
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ question: "how does it proceed?"
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ example: "walk from this apartment to the grocery store,
â”‚   â”‚              noting the sidewalks, crosswalks, and distances."
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ narrative
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ question: "how does it unfold as lived experience?"
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ example: "maria leaves her home, strolling past the bakery smells,
â”‚   â”‚              greeting a neighbor, and reaching the grocery in five minutes."
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ causal
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ question: "how do inputs lead to outcomes?"
â”‚   â”‚   â†³ example: "short blocks â†’ more walking â†’ health + economy + climate gains."
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ temporal
â”‚       â†³ question: "how does it change across time?"
â”‚       â†³ example: "1950 streetcar suburb â†’ 1980 arterial strip â†’ 2025 main street retrofit."
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ model
    â”œâ”€â”€ simulation
    â”‚   â†³ question: "how would it behave if modeled?"
    â”‚   â†³ example: "urban planning software shows how
    â”‚              adding sidewalks shifts daily trips from cars to walking."
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ prototype
    â”‚   â†³ question: "what form could it take?"
    â”‚   â†³ example: "build a model block with wide sidewalks,
    â”‚              corner cafÃ©s, and bike racks to embody walkability."
    â”‚
    â””â”€â”€ factorization
        â†³ question: "what are its components?"
        â†³ example: "proximity, safety, comfort, interest, connectivity as factors of walkability."

## ðŸŽ¯ notes
- **five clusters** organize the space of concept-demos:
  1. **instance** â†’ cases & boundaries
  2. **medium** â†’ change of representation
  3. **transfer** â†’ meaning carried across concepts
  4. **sequence** â†’ unfolding over time
  5. **model** â†’ embodiment in models/artifacts

- each subtype has a **walkability demo** attached for clarity.
