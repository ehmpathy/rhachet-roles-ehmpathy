# 🧩 .brief.article: `recommended structure of .brief.demo via example`

## 🌟 Introduction

A `.brief.demo` is a streamlined, example-driven document designed to illustrate a concept by presenting a specific instance of it in a structured Markdown format. By recommending a standardized structure with a focus on instantiating the concept, it ensures clarity, engagement, and adaptability for diverse audiences, from students to professionals.

## 📚 The Core Components

The `.brief.demo` follows a logical progression to build understanding step by step.

### 1. Concept Definition (💡)
This section provides a concise, one-sentence definition of the concept, setting the foundation without overwhelming the reader. It acts as the entry point, ensuring everyone starts on the same page.

- **Purpose**: To define the concept succinctly, avoiding jargon where possible.
- **Example in Practice**: For "use case," it might read: "A use case describes how a user interacts with a system to achieve a specific goal, detailing actors, steps, and system responses."

### 2. Guiding Question (❓)
A block-quoted question focuses the demo on a specific inquiry, typically "> What is an example of [concept]?" This prompts the reader to think about instantiation and leads directly into the example.

- **Purpose**: To create curiosity and direct attention to the example's role in answering the query.
- **Example in Practice**: "> What is an example of shear force?" sets up the instance of "scissors cutting paper."

### 3. Example Presentation (📌)
This is the heart of the `.brief.demo`, introducing the chosen example and breaking it into two subsections: "What" and "How."

- **What Subsection (📌.📖)**: Instantiates the concept by presenting the example in its most representative form, with a brief introduction and a structured format tailored to the concept (e.g., a use case template for "Booking a Flight" with Actor, Goal, Main Flow, Exceptions).
  - **Purpose**: To show the concept in action as directly as possible, making it tangible rather than abstract.
  - **Example in Practice**: For shear force, instantiate with the scenario of "scissors cutting paper," detailing the forces involved.

- **How Subsection (📌.🔍)**: Explains how the instantiated example embodies the concept, using a detailed outline (four sub-bullets with three sub-sub-bullets each) to connect features to the concept's traits.
  - **Purpose**: To provide depth and analysis, linking the instance back to the definition.
  - **Example in Practice**: For "Booking a Flight," outline how the Main Flow and Exceptions align with use case principles like user-system dialogue and exception handling.

# .brief.demo: `[concept] via example = [example]`

## 💡 Concept

[One-sentence definition of the concept, clear and concise.]

*Example*: [A brief example definition, e.g., "Shear force is a force applied parallel to a material’s surface, causing one portion to slide past another."]

## ❓ Question

> What is an example of [concept]?

## 📌 Example: [specific example]

### 📌.📖 What

> What is [specific example of the concept]?

[One- or two-sentence introduction to the example.]

[Structured instantiation, e.g., a template for use case, scenario for shear force, or specific item for tea.]

### 📌.🔍 How

> How is it an example of [concept]?

[One- or two-sentence explanation of how the example embodies the concept.]

- [Aspect 1 of the example’s alignment with the concept.]
  - [Detail 1 supporting the aspect.]
  - [Detail 2 supporting the aspect.]
  - [Detail 3 supporting the aspect.]
- [Aspect 2 of the example’s alignment with the concept.]
  - [Detail 1 supporting the aspect.]
  - [Detail 2 supporting the aspect.]
  - [Detail 3 supporting the aspect.]
- [Aspect 3 of the example’s alignment with the concept.]
  - [Detail 1 supporting the aspect.]
  - [Detail 2 supporting the aspect.]
  - [Detail 3 supporting the aspect.]
- [Aspect 4 of the example’s alignment with the concept.]
  - [Detail 1 supporting the aspect.]
  - [Detail 2 supporting the aspect.]
  - [Detail 3 supporting the aspect.]

## ✅ Benefits and Adaptability

The `.brief.demo` structure excels in its simplicity and power, enabling effective communication of any concept.

- **Clarity Through Instantiation**: By focusing the "What" section on instantiating the concept (e.g., a use case template rather than a general description), it makes abstract ideas like quantum entanglement concrete via a Bell test experiment.
- **Depth Without Overload**: The "How" section's outline ensures thorough explanation while keeping the document concise, adaptable for tangible concepts (e.g., tea as Darjeeling) or technical ones (e.g., shear force as scissors cutting paper).
- **Versatility for All Concepts**: Whether for meta-concepts (use case), physical forces (shear force), or abstracts (existentialism via a literary work), the structure accommodates by tailoring the instantiation, ensuring broad applicability.

This structure makes `.brief.demo` a powerful tool for education, documentation, and knowledge sharing, consistently delivering clear and engaging concept demonstrations.
