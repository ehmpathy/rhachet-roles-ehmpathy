## 🏙️ demonstration via city blocks
imagine two neighborhoods:

- **neighborhood a**
  - wide sidewalks shaded by trees
  - frequent crosswalks with signals
  - stores, cafes, and schools within a 10-minute walk
  - benches and lighting for comfort and safety

- **neighborhood b**
  - narrow or absent sidewalks
  - long stretches between safe crossings
  - destinations spaced far apart (requiring a car)
  - heavy traffic and poor lighting

residents of neighborhood a naturally walk more—for errands, social visits, or leisure—while residents of neighborhood b are discouraged from walking.

## 🚶 factors that demonstrate walkability
- **infrastructure**: presence and quality of sidewalks, crosswalks, lighting
- **safety**: traffic speed, crime risk, visibility
- **proximity**: density and closeness of daily destinations
- **comfort**: shade, benches, weather protection
- **aesthetics**: pleasing scenery, cleanliness, street life
