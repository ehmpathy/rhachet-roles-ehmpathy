# ðŸ§© .brief.demo: `walkability` â€” neighborhood errand scenario

## scenario
imagine a neighborhood in a mid-sized city.

- **block length**: the blocks are short, so crossing from one street to another doesnâ€™t require long detours.
- **sidewalk quality**: smooth, wide sidewalks line both sides of the street.
- **safety**: crosswalks are well-marked with pedestrian signals, and cars drive at moderate speeds.
- **proximity**: a grocery store, coffee shop, bus stop, and elementary school are all within a 5â€“10 minute walk from most homes.
- **aesthetics**: there are trees for shade, benches for resting, and storefronts that make the walk visually engaging.

## demonstration
a resident leaves their home to run errands.
- they walk **3 minutes** to buy bread at the corner bakery.
- they continue another **5 minutes** to drop a letter at the post office.
- along the way, they pass neighbors on the sidewalk, stop briefly to chat, and feel safe doing so because traffic is calm.

## why this demonstrates walkability
- **convenience**: daily needs are met without requiring a car.
- **safety**: infrastructure reduces risk from vehicles.
- **enjoyment**: the experience of walking is pleasant, not just functional.
- **community**: the design fosters casual social encounters.
