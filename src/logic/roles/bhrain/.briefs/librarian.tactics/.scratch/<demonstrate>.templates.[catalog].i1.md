# ðŸ“˜ template catalog for `.brief.demo`

here are strong template patterns you can use for **demonstration briefs** â€” each one is designed to *show* a concept in action rather than just describe it.

---

## 1. worked example
\`\`\`
# ðŸ§© .brief: `<concept>` demo

## example scenario
- step 1: [set the stage with a real-world case]
- step 2: [apply the concept in action]
- step 3: [show the result / outcome]

## takeaway
- what the example proves about the concept
- why the demonstration matters
\`\`\`

---

## 2. before vs after
\`\`\`
# ðŸ§© .brief: `<concept>` demo

## before
[show the situation without the concept]

## after
[show the transformed state with the concept applied]

## what changed
- highlight the visible difference
- attribute the change directly to the concept
\`\`\`

---

## 3. analogy in action
\`\`\`
# ðŸ§© .brief: `<concept>` demo

## analogy
[frame the concept through a familiar metaphor]

## parallel action
- map the steps of the analogy to the conceptâ€™s mechanics
- highlight observable similarities

## insight
- what the analogy reveals about how the concept works
\`\`\`

---

## 4. mini case study
\`\`\`
# ðŸ§© .brief: `<concept>` demo

## context
[short description of the environment, actors, or problem]

## demonstration
- what actions were taken that embody the concept
- what sequence occurred in practice

## outcome
- the observed effect or change
- lesson distilled from the case
\`\`\`

---

## 5. contrastive spotlight
\`\`\`
# ðŸ§© .brief: `<concept>` demo

## close contrast
- show two elements that differ only by presence/absence of the concept
- make the difference observable and concrete

## spotlight
- call attention to the precise point where the concept is doing work

## conclusion
- confirm what this contrast makes undeniable about the concept
\`\`\`

---

## ðŸ”‘ keys to strength
- anchor the concept in **observable evidence**
- follow a clear **setup â†’ action â†’ outcome** arc
- keep the **takeaway** explicit so the demo isnâ€™t mistaken for just an anecdote
