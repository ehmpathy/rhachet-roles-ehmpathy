librarian tactics are all [brief]work
- [article]s (<articulate>)
- [catalog]s (<catalogize>)
- [gallery][example]s (<illustrate>)
- [gallery][review]s (<?>) (no generator for them? since they're detected / pulled / measured)

the librarian gets and sets [brief]s

the librarian is commonly asked to mutate focus
- get briefs
- compress per goal
- set focus.context
