# 🧩 .brief: `example vs demo in concept domain`

## .what
within the domain of **concepts**, both **examples** and **demos** are ways of *articulating a concept*.
- an **example** is a *static referent*: it points to an instance of the concept.
- a **demo** is a *dynamic articulation*: it performs or enacts the concept in action.

---

## 🔑 relation

- **example**
  - scope: *instance of concept*
  - function: anchors meaning by showing “what counts as” the concept
  - mode: static, referential
  - question answered: *“what is it like?”*

- **demo**
  - scope: *process of concept*
  - function: animates meaning by showing “how the concept works”
  - mode: dynamic, procedural
  - question answered: *“how does it work?”*

## 📐 hierarchy in concept articulation

- **concept demonstrations (demo, genus)**
  - **example** → *demonstration by instance*
  - **analogy** → *demonstration by mapping to another concept*
  - **walkthrough** → *demonstration by stepwise unfolding*
  - **simulation** → *demonstration by model in operation*

---

## 🎯 takeaway
- in the **concept domain**, an **example is indeed a type of demo** — but specifically the **static subtype** (demonstration by pointing to an instance).
- demos, taken as the broader genus, encompass not just examples but also other forms of concept enactment.
