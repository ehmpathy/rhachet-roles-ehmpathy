# 🧩 .brief: `<articulation>.tactic.templates-exemplars`

## .what
**`<articulation>.tactic.templates-exemplars`** is a structured method for composing an [article] by **anchoring its form** to pre-established **templates** and **exemplars**.
the tactic recognizes that **different usecases** — and different **focal.acuity** levels — require **different structural patterns** for clarity, completeness, and efficiency.

---

## 🎯 goal
- **speed**: reduce cognitive load by starting from a proven structure
- **consistency**: ensure similar usecases share a coherent form
- **acuity-alignment**: match the article’s structure to the intended depth, breadth, and granularity of focus

---

## ⚙️ method

1. **determine acuity profile**
   - assess **focal.acuity**: how granular should the article be?
   - align to purpose: is this a high-level overview, detailed technical spec, or deep analytical dive?

2. **select a matching template**
   - choose from a library of predefined skeletons, each optimized for certain acuity levels and audiences
   - templates specify **section order**, **content slots**, and **minimum coverage**

3. **review relevant exemplars**
   - pull in past [articles] that match the chosen template and purpose
   - note stylistic choices, flow, and any domain-specific conventions

4. **map content to structure**
   - fit your content into the **template slots**, adapting as needed
   - use exemplars as **style and completeness guides**

5. **iterate for fit**
   - ensure the final shape reflects both the **content’s natural flow** and the **acuity requirements**
   - adjust structure only if it improves clarity or precision

---

## 📐 why it works
- **pattern reuse**: avoids reinventing structural logic each time
- **cotext sensitivity**: ensures different acuities get different forms, avoiding under- or over-specification
- **learning by example**: exemplars illustrate successful executions, reducing ambiguity in applying the template

---

## 🔄 relation to other `<articulation>` tactics
- complements **freeform exploration** by providing **scaffolding** rather than constraints
- pairs well with **checklist-driven articulation** to ensure completeness within the chosen template
- can be combined with **acuity-zoom tactics** to progressively refine structure

---

## 🛠 example usage
- **low acuity** (overview) → use a **3-section template**: `.what`, `.why`, `.impact`
- **high acuity** (technical deep dive) → use a **multi-section template**: `.what`, `.why`, `.how`, `.tradeoffs`, `.examples`, `.references`
- review past [articles] in the same category to emulate tone, ordering, and coverage
