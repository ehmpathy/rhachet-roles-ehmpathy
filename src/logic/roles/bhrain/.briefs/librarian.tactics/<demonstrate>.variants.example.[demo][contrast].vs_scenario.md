# 🧩 example vs scenario

## 🔎 example
- **nature:** a specific *instance* that illustrates a concept
- **form:** short, concrete, often stripped down to highlight one feature
- **purpose:** show what something *looks like in practice*

**example:**
> concept: walkability
> example: “downtown portland — groceries, schools, and cafés within 10 minutes’ walk.”

---

## 🔎 scenario
- **nature:** a *story-like setup* that situates the concept in a context of time, actors, and conditions
- **form:** longer, situational, often includes multiple steps or unfolding events
- **purpose:** simulate how the concept *plays out dynamically* in a lived or hypothetical situation

**scenario:**
> concept: walkability
> scenario: “a family with one car moves into a portland neighborhood. the kids walk to school, the parents walk to the café to work remotely, errands like groceries and pharmacy are done on foot. the car is only needed for weekend trips.”

## 🧩 core distinction
- **example** = *snapshot* (static instance)
- **scenario** = *mini-drama* (dynamic unfolding)
