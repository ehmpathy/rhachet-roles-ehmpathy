# 📚 .catalog: `<articulation>.tactics`

## .what
A reference set of professional strategies for improving the **clarity, completeness, and resonance** of a concept when composing an [article].

---

## 🛠 tactics

### 1. **checklist-driven articulation**
> use a predefined list of *must-cover* elements to ensure completeness.
- best for compliance, standards, and repeatable formats
- example: medical case reports, technical audits

---

### 2. **progressive refinement**
> start broad, then iteratively zoom into detail (high → medium → low acuity).
- prevents getting stuck in minutiae early
- example: write `.what` at overview level, then deepen `.how` and `.why` in passes

---

### 3. **compare-and-contrast framing**
> define the concept by placing it alongside similar or opposite concepts.
- accelerates reader understanding via reference points
- example: feature comparison charts, pros-vs-cons lists

---

### 4. **story-path anchoring**
> embed the concept in a narrative arc — problem → struggle → resolution.
- engages attention, aids memory
- example: user journey stories, before/after scenarios

---

### 5. **taxonomy positioning**
> locate the concept within a larger system or hierarchy.
- clarifies scope, boundaries, and related concepts
- example: placing a technology in a standards stack diagram

---

### 6. **question-driven expansion**
> use targeted interrogatives (`what`, `why`, `how`, `when`, `who`, `where`) to systematically fill gaps.
- works well with `<ponder>` and `<enquestion>`
- example: investigative reporting, root-cause analysis

---

### 7. **pattern abstraction**
> generalize from specific instances to reveal the underlying structure or principle.
- good for reusable methods and cross-domain lessons
- example: abstracting a “sales funnel” pattern from multiple case studies

---

### 8. **reverse articulation**
> start from the end result or key takeaway and work backward to the core concept.
- ensures purpose-driven clarity
- example: explaining a research conclusion by retracing the evidence path

---

### 9. **visual scaffolding**
> pair text with diagrams, charts, or schemas that mirror the article structure.
- improves retention and helps readers navigate complex content
- example: flowcharts for process explanations, mindmaps for relationships

---

### 10. **multi-perspective synthesis**
> integrate views from different roles, disciplines, or stakeholders.
- reveals hidden constraints and broader implications
- example: combining engineer, designer, and end-user perspectives in a product spec

---

## 🔄 usage
- select 1–3 tactics per [article] depending on **goal**, **audience**, and **acuity**
- can be sequenced (e.g., start with **story-path anchoring**, end with **taxonomy positioning**)
- most effective when paired with **templates-exemplars** to keep structure coherent
