# 🧩 .brief.demo: `example vs visual`

## .what
to **demonstrate the difference** between an *example* and a *visual* in the domain of concepts,
we show the same concept clarified in two different ways:

---

## 🎓 concept chosen: *walkability*

### **example**
- *form*: descriptive instance
- *demo*:
  “downtown portland is highly walkable — grocery stores, schools, and cafes are all within a 10-minute walk.”
- *signal*: this case *counts as* walkability.

---

### **visual**
- *form*: diagrammatic rendering
- *demo*:
  imagine a **map sketch** with:
  - a house icon at the center
  - nearby icons for 🛒 grocery, 🏫 school, ☕ cafe
  - all enclosed in a shaded **10-minute walking radius** circle.
- *signal*: this makes walkability *visible*.

---

## 🔑 contrast
- the **example** anchors the concept in a **real instance**.
- the **visual** renders the concept in a **visible form**.
- together, they show:
  - *what counts as it* (example)
  - *what it looks like* (visual).

---

## 🎯 takeaway
- use an **example** when you want to ground the concept with a concrete case.
- use a **visual** when you want to reveal its structure, relation, or appearance.
