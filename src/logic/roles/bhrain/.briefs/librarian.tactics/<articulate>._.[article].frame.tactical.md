# 🧩 .brief: `articulate`

## .what
**`articulate`** is a **focus.motion** primitive that transforms an in-progress concept into a **clear, explicit, and shareable form**.
It takes an internal, often fuzzy understanding and **renders it into precise language or representation**, making it accessible for others — or for one’s own future self.

---

## 🎯 goal
- convert **implicit understanding** into **explicit expression**
- ensure the concept is **comprehensible, accurate, and usable**
- provide a **stable reference** for discussion, reasoning, or implementation

---

## ⚙️ method
1. **anchor**
   - establish the core concept or seed you’re articulating
   - lock in scope and avoid redefining mid-process

2. **structure**
   - choose an organizational frame (outline, template, narrative, gallery-based, etc.)
   - match format to purpose and audience

3. **express**
   - render the concept in clear, direct language
   - surface key attributes, context, and distinctions

4. **refine**
   - check for clarity, completeness, and fidelity to the original intent
   - adjust wording or structure as needed

---

## 📐 when to use
- when a concept needs to move from **thought** to **communicable form**
- when collaborating, teaching, or documenting
- when ambiguity is blocking decision-making or action

---

## 💡 notes
- articulation is **not invention** — the core concept should already exist, even if only as a seed
- the **acuity** of articulation depends on how well attributes, context, and boundaries are surfaced
- can be combined with other tactics (e.g., template-driven, exemplar-driven) for different use cases
