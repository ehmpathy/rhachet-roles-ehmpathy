# .brief.demo: `walkability` via `counter` = `phoenix suburbs`

## 💡 concept
walkability is the measure of how friendly an area is to walking, determined by the proximity of daily needs, the quality of pedestrian infrastructure, and the safety and comfort of the walking environment.

## 📌 counter-example: phoenix suburbs

### 📌.📖 what

> what are the phoenix suburbs?

the sprawling suburbs around phoenix, arizona, are characterized by low-density housing, wide arterial roads, and zoning that separates residential areas from commercial and institutional uses. daily needs are typically spread out across miles, accessible primarily by car.

- **long distances to daily needs**
  - grocery stores, schools, and cafes located far from most homes
    - *example:* a typical subdivision may require a 15–20 minute drive to reach basic shopping
- **disconnected infrastructure**
  - large blocks, wide intersections, and missing sidewalks
    - *example:* six-lane arterial roads without pedestrian crossings for half a mile
- **unsafe crossings**
  - intersections designed for vehicle throughput, not pedestrians
    - *example:* high-speed right-turn lanes with no pedestrian refuge
- **weak transit integration**
  - bus routes are sparse and stops often lack safe walking access
    - *example:* bus stops located on roads without sidewalks or shelters

### 📌.🔍 how

> how is the phoenix suburban pattern a counter-example of walkability?

phoenix suburbs highlight the absence of walkability through **distance**, **design**, and **dependence**:

- **distance**: residential and commercial areas are so spread out that walking is impractical for daily errands.
- **design**: streets prioritize car speed and capacity, making walking unpleasant and often dangerous.
- **dependence**: car ownership becomes a necessity, as walking and transit provide no viable alternative.
- **comfort and safety**: the harsh desert climate, combined with limited shade and long stretches without sidewalks, further discourages walking.

this counter-example shows that when urban planning prioritizes cars over people, walkability disappears—underscoring why compact, mixed-use, and pedestrian-first design is essential for creating walkable places.
