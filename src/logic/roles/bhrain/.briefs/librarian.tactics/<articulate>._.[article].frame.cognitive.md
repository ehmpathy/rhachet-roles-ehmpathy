# 🗣️ .brief: `<articulate>`

## 🧭 .what
`<articulate>` is a **focus.motion.acuity** primitive on the `.attributes` subaxis. it moves **inward** (`.attributes++`) to enrich the **same** anchor concept by surfacing explicit traits. the anchor does not change; only the **resolution** of its description increases.

---

## 🎯 purpose
- transform a minimal or vague seed into a **clear, operational brief**
- answer guiding questions to surface **surface-level attributes**
- unlock **variation potential** by increasing `focal.acuity`

---

## 🔗 relation to `focus.motion.acuity`
- **subaxis** → `.attributes`
- **motion** → `++` (enrich)
- **direction** → inward (sharpen)
- **effect** → reveals finer surface traits without changing the anchor

---

## 🌿 treestruct interaction
- **anchor** stays fixed: `focus.concept` is not swapped
- **acuity** increases: more traits are cognitively present
- surfaced traits can be used immediately for `<cluster>`, `<compare>`, or `<generalize>`

---

## 📎 notes
- `<articulate>` is for **attributes** only — use `<decompose>` for internal parts (`.substructs++`).
- It is often run **after `<gather>`** and **before `<cluster>`**.
- Higher acuity increases cognitive load; apply when precision directly benefits the reasoning goal.
