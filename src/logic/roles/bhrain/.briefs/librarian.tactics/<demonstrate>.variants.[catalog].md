## 🎯 notes
- the **root** = `concept demonstration (demo)` = the broad genus.
- **example** is one **branch** (static subtype).
- other branches (analogy, walkthrough, simulation, prototype) capture different modes of concept enactment.
- each branch answers a different **clarifying question** about the concept.
