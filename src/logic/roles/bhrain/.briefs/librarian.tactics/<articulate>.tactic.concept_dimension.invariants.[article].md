# 🧩 .brief: `concept.dimensions.generic`

## .what
**`concept.dimensions.generic`** defines the **invariant semantic dimensions** that can be articulated for *any* [concept] in an [article], regardless of domain.
these dimensions form a **semantic skeleton** — the minimal, always-present slots for fully describing a concept.

---

## 🎯 goal
- provide a **universal template** for [article] articulation
- ensure **concept descriptions** are complete, consistent, and comparable
- enable automation in concept documentation and reasoning flows

## 📐 dimensions

| dimension       | question it answers                | description | why it’s always articulable |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| **.what**       | “what is it?”                      | definition and identity — what makes it this concept and not something else | every concept has an identity to distinguish it from others |
| **.why**        | “why does it exist?”               | purpose, goal, or motivating function | every concept emerges from some need, cause, or intention |
| **.how**        | “how does it work?”                | mechanisms, processes, or methods | every concept operates in some way, even abstractly |
| **.where**      | “where does it apply?”             | domain, scope, or applicable contexts | every concept exists in a context or environment |
| **.when**       | “when is it relevant?”             | temporal aspect — timing, lifecycle, or stage relevance | every concept has moments when it applies or manifests |
| **.who**        | “who is involved?”                 | agents, roles, or entities that use, own, or are affected by it | every concept has some relationship to actors |
| **.attributes** | “what qualities does it have?”     | intrinsic traits, descriptors, or parameters | every concept has distinguishable features |
| **.relations**  | “what is it connected to?”         | links to other concepts — dependencies, contrasts, hierarchies | no concept exists in total isolation |
| **.examples**   | “what does it look like in action?” | concrete instances or scenarios that embody it | every concept can be grounded by illustration |
| **.variants**   | “what forms can it take?”          | versions, subtypes, or adaptations | concepts can be generalized or specialized |
| **.tradeoffs**  | “what are its strengths & limits?” | pros, cons, constraints, and opportunity costs | every concept has both enabling and limiting factors |

## 🛠 usage
use `concept.dimensions.generic` as the **default frame** when authoring any [article] about a [concept].
even if some slots are left empty, their presence maintains **structural completeness** and improves cross-concept comparability.
