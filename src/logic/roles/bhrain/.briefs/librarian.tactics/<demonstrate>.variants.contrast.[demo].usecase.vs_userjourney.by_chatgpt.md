# .brief.demo: `use case` via `contrast` = `use case vs user journey`

## 💡 concept
a use case describes how a user interacts with a system to achieve a specific goal, while a user journey maps the broader, often emotional, experience of a user across multiple touchpoints with a product or service.

## ❓ question
> how does a use case contrast with a user journey?

## 📌 contrast: use case vs user journey

### 📌.📖 what

> what are use cases and user journeys?

- **use case**
  - focuses on *functional interaction* between user and system.
  - defines *actors, steps, and system responses* leading to a specific outcome.
  - *example:* “a customer books a flight on an airline’s website.”

- **user journey**
  - focuses on *holistic experience* across touchpoints.
  - includes *motivations, emotions, and pain points* before, during, and after interaction.
  - *example:* “a traveler researches destinations, compares prices, books a flight, receives updates, travels, and later reviews the airline.”

### 📌.🔍 how

> how does this contrast demonstrate the concept of use case?

- **scope**
  - a use case is **narrow**, zooming into a single functional interaction.
  - a user journey is **broad**, mapping multiple interactions across a timeline.

- **focus**
  - a use case emphasizes **system behavior**: “what happens when the user does X?”
  - a user journey emphasizes **user experience**: “how does the user feel at each stage?”

- **artifact**
  - use case outputs are structured step-by-step flows of user + system actions.
  - user journey outputs are visual maps, storyboards, or timelines showing phases and emotions.

- **example contrast**
  - **use case:** “customer selects flight → enters details → system confirms booking.”
  - **user journey:** “customer dreams of vacation → compares airlines → struggles with hidden fees → books → feels reassured by confirmation → experiences anxiety waiting for boarding.”

this contrast clarifies that a **use case is about functionality**, while a **user journey is about experience**. together, they complement each other, but they are not the same.
