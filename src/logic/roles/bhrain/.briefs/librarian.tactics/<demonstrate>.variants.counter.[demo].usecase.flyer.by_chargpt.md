## 📌 counter-example: restaurant menu flyer

### 📌.📖 what

> what is the restaurant menu flyer?

a printed restaurant menu flyer is a static list of food items and prices distributed for advertising purposes. it provides information but does not describe any user interactions, system responses, or step-by-step goals.

- **static content**
  - lists meals, prices, and phone number
  - *example:* a pizza shop flyer with daily specials
- **no interactive process**
  - customer may see the flyer, but the flyer itself does not facilitate ordering
- **no system responses**
  - the flyer cannot process actions or provide feedback
- **actors missing**
  - does not define the roles of customer, staff, or delivery process

### 📌.🔍 how

> how is a restaurant menu flyer a counter-example of a use case?

the menu flyer illustrates what a use case is *not*, because it lacks:

- **interaction**: there is no dynamic exchange between user and system—only one-way information.
- **steps**: no sequence of actions leading to a goal is described.
- **actors and responses**: the flyer does not specify participants or their roles, nor does it capture how a system responds to user input.
- **goal structure**: while the flyer hints at a potential outcome (ordering food), it does not map the process of achieving that outcome.

this counter-example shows that a use case requires **structured interaction** and **defined roles**, not just information or content.
