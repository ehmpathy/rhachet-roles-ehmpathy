# 🧩 .brief.demo: `transfer subtypes for walkability`

## .what
to **demonstrate the transfer branch** of concept-demos,
we apply each subtype (analogy, metaphor, simile, allegory) to the same seed concept: *walkability*.

---

## 🎓 concept: *walkability*

### **analogy** — structured transfer
“walkability is like a **circulatory system**:
- sidewalks are arteries,
- intersections are valves,
- parks are lungs,
- stores are nutrients.”

➡ explicit structure → target concept mapped part-by-part.

---

### **metaphor** — figurative transfer
“walkability is **oxygen** for a city.”

➡ implicit substitution → the concept *is* another thing, to highlight necessity.

---

### **simile** — explicit figurative transfer
“a walkable neighborhood feels **like a living room** — everything is close, familiar, and reachable without effort.”

➡ same as metaphor but explicitly marked with “like / as.”

---

### **allegory** — extended transfer
“a city without walkability is a **kingdom without paths**:
- villages remain isolated,
- markets cannot thrive,
- citizens are trapped in their own walls.
when paths connect the kingdom, community, trade, and culture flow freely.”

➡ narrative system → the concept is embodied in a story-world.

---

## 🎯 takeaway
- **analogy** = precise, part-by-part mapping
- **metaphor** = compressed figurative identity
- **simile** = signposted figurative likeness
- **allegory** = extended narrative system

all four belong to the **transfer** branch of concept-demos.
