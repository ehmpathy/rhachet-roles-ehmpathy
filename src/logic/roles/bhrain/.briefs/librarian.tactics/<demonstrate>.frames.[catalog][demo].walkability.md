# 🧩 .brief.demo: walkability — examples across demo structures

below are eight ways to demonstrate the concept of **walkability**, each with a compact example.

---

## 1) contrast demo — **two places, side by side**
**title:** walkability via neighborhood contrast
**example:**
- **neighborhood a:** sidewalks both sides, 4-way crosswalks, café + park within 8 min, 25 mph traffic.
- **neighborhood b:** no sidewalks, 45 mph arterial, nearest café 2.1 miles, few crossings.
**takeaway:** same city, different design → radically different walking behavior.

---

## 2) scale demo — **low → medium → high**
**title:** walkability along a spectrum
**example:**
- **low:** cul-de-sac subdivision; 1 entry/exit; nearest store 30 min walk.
- **medium:** grid-ish blocks; mixed townhouses; daily needs in 12–15 min walk.
- **high:** fine-grained grid; corner shops; transit hub; most errands in 5–8 min.
**takeaway:** walkability increases with tighter blocks, mixed uses, and nearby essentials.

---

## 3) component demo — **factor-by-factor**
**title:** walkability via components
**example:**
- **proximity:** groceries ≤ 800 m; school ≤ 1 km.
- **safety:** < 30 mph, frequent crossings, daylighting at corners.
- **comfort:** 6–8 ft sidewalks, trees every 30 ft, benches per 400 ft.
- **interest:** active ground floors, windows, varied façades.
- **connectivity:** block lengths ≤ 120 m; few dead-ends.
**takeaway:** strengthen any weak component to lift overall walkability.

## 4) lived-experience demo — **day in a life**
**title:** walkability through a resident’s routine
**example (alex, lives in “maple row”):**
- 7:50 — walks 6 min with kid to school (signalized crossing).
- 8:05 — continues 4 min to café; meets neighbor en route.
- 17:30 — picks up groceries (3 min detour) and walks home.
**counterfactual (same city, “pine ridge”):** all trips require a car; no incidental errands.
**takeaway:** design choices shape daily time, cost, and social ties.

---

## 5) quantitative demo — **metrics & indices**
**title:** walkability by numbers
**example:**
- **10-min walk shed (800 m):**
  - **maple row:** 68% of homes reach ≥ 5 daily needs (grocery, pharmacy, K-8, park, café).
  - **pine ridge:** 9% of homes reach ≥ 2 daily needs.
- **intersection density:** 110 vs 28 per km².
- **estimated mode share (walk for short trips):** 34% vs 6%.
**takeaway:** simple metrics reveal practical accessibility gaps.

---

## 6) visual demo — **map/diagram description**
**title:** walkability via annotated map
**example (what the figure shows):**
- two 800 m radius circles centered on homes.
- **map a:** tight street grid; POI icons sprinkled throughout; continuous sidewalk lines.
- **map b:** superblocks; cul-de-sacs; POIs clustered along a high-speed arterial with few crossings.
**takeaway:** spatial patterns make (or break) a 10-minute life.

---

## 7) causal-chain demo — **from inputs to outcomes**
**title:** walkability → health, economy, climate
**example:**
- **inputs:** short blocks + crossings + shade + nearby stores
→ **behavior:** more walking for errands
→ **outcomes:**
  - **health:** +weekly active minutes, ↓ cardiovascular risk
  - **economy:** higher footfall supports small businesses
  - **climate:** fewer short car trips, ↓ local emissions
  - **social:** more chance encounters, stronger cohesion
**takeaway:** built form → behavior → community-level benefits.

---

## 8) temporal demo — **before/after over time**
**title:** walkability across eras
**example:**
- **1950 (“streetcar-era main st”):** mixed uses, 2–3 story buildings, frequent transit; most daily trips on foot.
- **1980 (“arterial retail strip”):** widened roads, setback parking, single-use zoning; walking declines.
- **2025 (“main st retrofit”):** road diet, infill housing, corner stores, safer crossings; walking rebounds.
**takeaway:** policy and design cycles can degrade or restore walkability.
