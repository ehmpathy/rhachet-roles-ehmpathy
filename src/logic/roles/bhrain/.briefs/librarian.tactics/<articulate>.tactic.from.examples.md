# üß© .brief: `articulate.via.examples`

## .what
**`articulate.via.examples`** is an **articulation tactic** that uses a **curated set of illustrative examples** as the *source lens* for expression.
instead of starting from abstract definition alone, we draw meaning and nuance from **specific, well-chosen examples**, then generalize or synthesize into a coherent articulation.

---

## üéØ goal
- ground articulation in **tangible, relatable instances**
- capture **implicit patterns** and **hidden traits** that emerge from examples
- ensure descriptions are **anchored to reality** rather than drifting into abstraction

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è method
1. **curate examples**
   - gather a diverse yet representative set of examples that express the concept in action
   - ensure variety in form, context, and perspective

2. **observe & extract**
   - identify recurring traits, contrasts, and anomalies
   - note emotional, functional, and structural elements

3. **abstract & articulate**
   - generalize from observations into a clear, structured articulation
   - weave in example references as anchors or supporting points

4. **verify coverage**
   - check that the articulation reflects the **breadth** of the examples, not just a single outlier

---

## üìê when to use
- when a concept is **experiential, aesthetic, or contextual**
- when definitions alone fail to capture **richness or nuance**
- when multiple audiences must relate through **concrete illustration**

---

## üí° notes
- the **quality of articulation** depends directly on the **quality of curation**
- works well in combination with **template-driven articulation** for structure
- danger: overfitting articulation to the quirks of chosen examples ‚Äî mitigate with diverse selection
