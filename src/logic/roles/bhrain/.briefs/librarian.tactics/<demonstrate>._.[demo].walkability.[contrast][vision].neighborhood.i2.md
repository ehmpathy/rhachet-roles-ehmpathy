# 🧩 .brief.demo: `walkability via contrast in vision`

## .what
walkability refers to how friendly an environment is to walking as a mode of travel.
to demonstrate it, we contrast two *visions* of the same street environment: one prioritizing cars, the other prioritizing people on foot.

---

## 🚗 car-centric vision
- wide lanes and fast-moving traffic dominate the view
- sidewalks, if present, are narrow and pushed against noisy roads
- crossings are infrequent, long, and feel unsafe
- the visual horizon is filled with parking lots, signage for drivers, and highway overpasses

**result:** pedestrians appear small, vulnerable, and out of place.

---

## 🚶 human-centric vision
- wide, shaded sidewalks lined with trees
- frequent, clearly marked crosswalks with signals that favor pedestrians
- storefronts, benches, and small parks activate the street edge
- buildings and landmarks create a visual scale aligned with human height and pace

**result:** pedestrians appear natural, visible, and central to the environment.

---

## 🔍 contrast as demonstration
- **visibility:** in the car vision, pedestrians fade into the background; in the human vision, they *stand out*.
- **scale:** the car vision makes humans feel dwarfed, while the human vision restores proportion.
- **orientation:** car vision pulls the eye along asphalt corridors, while human vision frames walking paths, social nooks, and eye-level experiences.

## 🎯 takeaway
the contrast in vision demonstrates that walkability is not only about physical infrastructure but also about how the environment *appears* and *feels* to those moving through it.
when the visual design centers the pedestrian, walkability rises; when it centers vehicles, walkability collapses.
