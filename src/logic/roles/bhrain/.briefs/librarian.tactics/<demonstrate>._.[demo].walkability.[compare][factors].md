# üß© .brief.demo: walkability via components

## definition
the **component demo** breaks walkability into its **key dimensions** and illustrates each one separately. this shows that walkability is not a single trait but a composite quality ‚Äî strong in some places, weak in others.

## components of walkability

### 1. **proximity** ‚Äî how close daily needs are
- **good case:** grocery, caf√©, school, and park all within 5‚Äì10 minutes on foot.
- **poor case:** nearest grocery 2 miles away, requiring a car.
‚û° proximity sets the foundation: if destinations are too far, walking isn‚Äôt viable no matter how nice the sidewalks are.

---

### 2. **safety** ‚Äî freedom from traffic danger and crime risk
- **good case:** well-marked crosswalks every 100 m, traffic calmed to 25 mph, adequate lighting.
- **poor case:** six-lane arterial with 45 mph traffic, rare crossings, dimly lit sidewalks.
‚û° safety determines whether people *feel* and *are* protected while walking.

---

### 3. **comfort** ‚Äî physical ease of the walk
- **good case:** sidewalks ‚â• 6 ft wide, shaded by trees, benches every 400 ft, smooth pavement.
- **poor case:** broken sidewalks, no shade in summer, puddles in winter, no resting spots.
‚û° comfort affects willingness to walk regularly, not just occasionally.

---

### 4. **interest** ‚Äî variety and stimulation along the path
- **good case:** storefronts with windows, diverse building fronts, murals, trees, street activity.
- **poor case:** blank walls, parking lots, empty fields, monotonous housing fa√ßades.
‚û° interest keeps walks engaging, preventing the ‚Äúnothing to see here‚Äù effect.

---

### 5. **connectivity** ‚Äî how well the street network links together
- **good case:** short blocks (<120 m), multiple routes to destinations, few dead ends.
- **poor case:** cul-de-sacs feeding into arterials; one route only, long detours.
‚û° connectivity shapes the efficiency and flexibility of walking trips.

## insight
- each component can be assessed **individually** and **improved independently**.
- weak performance in one dimension (e.g., proximity) can undermine strengths in others (e.g., comfort).
- true walkability emerges when **all five components** align, creating an environment where walking is safe, practical, and enjoyable.
