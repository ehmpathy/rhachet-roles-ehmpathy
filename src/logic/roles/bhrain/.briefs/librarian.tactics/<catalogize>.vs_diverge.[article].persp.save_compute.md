# üß© .brief: `perspective on <catalogize> as a tactic`

## .what
**`<catalogize>`** is a tactic designed to systematically organize a wide array of concepts into a coherent structure or system. It aims to identify, classify, and relate distinct concepts within a given scope, providing clarity and facilitating understanding through structured representation.

---

## üéØ core perspective
`<catalogize>` has parallels with the tactic known as **`<diverge>`**, particularly in its ability to handle diverse concepts. However, while **`<diverge>`** seeks to generate concepts expansively and without immediate structure, `<catalogize>` benefits from leveraging pre-diverged content to focus on the task of organizing and classifying these ideas effectively.

> üß© Diverging first provides a rich dataset for `<catalogize>` to work with, enhancing the quality and scope of the cataloging process.

## ‚öôÔ∏è operational insight
- **similarity to `<diverge>`**:
  - both can zero shot concepts, initiating from nothing to create content.
  - both aim to cover a wide range of concepts, albeit with different end goals.

- **difference from `<diverge>`**:
  - `<diverge>` focuses on ideation, while `<catalogize>` focuses on organization.
  - `<catalogize>` benefits from having pre-diverged outputs in the focus.concept, allowing it to allocate cognitive resources towards effective cataloging rather than ideation.

- **optimization hypothesis**:
  - with pre-diverged outputs, `<catalogize>` saves LLM compute for cataloging activities, enhancing efficiency and depth without spending resources on divergence.

- **best practice**:
  - ideally, one uses **`<diverge>`** initially to ensure a broad and diverse set of concepts, then employs `<catalogize>` to impose structure and order.

---

## üìê strategic use
- Initialization: `<diverge>` generates a wide-ranging set of concepts.
- Progression: Leveraged **divergent outputs** in focus.concept for `<catalogize>`.
- Convergence: `<catalogize>` filters, categorizes, and arranges these into a meaningful, structured framework.

---

## üéØ benefits
- **Efficiency**: By separating the divergent and cataloging phases, you conserve mental energy and optimize the capacity of each tactic.
- **Comprehensiveness**: Ensures a thorough exploration of the concept space prior to imposing a structure.
- **Clarity**: Results in a refined, organized output that enhances understanding of complex ideas.

> Adopting this approach means `<catalogize>` doesn't waste compute on generating, but focuses on delivering a structured and meaningful catalog.
