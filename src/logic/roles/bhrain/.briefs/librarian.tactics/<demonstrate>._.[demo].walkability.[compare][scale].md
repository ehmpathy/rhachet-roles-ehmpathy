# ðŸ§© .brief.demo: walkability via scale

## definition
the **scale demo** shows walkability not as a binary (walkable vs. not) but as a **continuum**, illustrating how environments can incrementally become more or less walkable.

---

## the scale
### 1. **low walkability â€” car-oriented suburb**
- **layout:** cul-de-sacs, single entry/exit points, disconnected streets.
- **destinations:** grocery store, school, and park all > 2 miles away.
- **infrastructure:** no sidewalks; wide, fast arterials; parking lots front every building.
- **experience:** unsafe, impractical, and unpleasant to walk.
âž¡ **result:** walking share of trips < 5%.

---

### 2. **medium walkability â€” mixed suburban fabric**
- **layout:** partial grid with some through streets; moderate block sizes.
- **destinations:** small shopping center and school within ~15 minutesâ€™ walk.
- **infrastructure:** sidewalks on main roads but gaps elsewhere; some shade and crossings.
- **experience:** walking is possible but not always comfortable or convenient.
âž¡ **result:** walking share of trips ~15%.

---

### 3. **high walkability â€” urban core**
- **layout:** fine-grained grid, short blocks, multiple routes.
- **destinations:** daily needs (grocery, cafÃ©, pharmacy, school, park) within 5â€“10 minutes.
- **infrastructure:** continuous sidewalks, safe crossings every 80â€“100 m, street trees, benches.
- **experience:** walking is natural, enjoyable, and often the fastest option.
âž¡ **result:** walking share of trips > 30%.

## insight
- the **scale** demonstrates how walkability is **additive**: each improvement (shorter blocks, more destinations, better sidewalks) raises the baseline.
- it also highlights the **nonlinear jump**: once enough elements combine, walking shifts from rare to default.
