# 🧩 .brief: `articulate.tactic.from.seed`

## .what
**`articulate.tactic.from.seed`** is an **articulation tactic** that grows a complete, coherent expression of a concept starting from a **minimal viable seed**.
instead of beginning with an elaborate structure, the articulation emerges through **progressive expansion** — the seed acts as the anchor that keeps the work aligned while details are developed.

---

## 🎯 goal
- expand from a **single point of clarity** into a fully formed articulation
- maintain **focus and scope control** during expansion
- ensure the final form aligns with the original **intent encapsulated in the seed**

---

## ⚙️ method
1. **capture the seed**
   - define the smallest meaningful unit of the concept (e.g., [title], key phrase, keyword cluster)
   - ensure it expresses the core intent without unnecessary detail

2. **expand the context**
   - recall or research relevant background, audience, and constraints
   - collect related facts, patterns, and perspectives tied to the seed

3. **structure the growth**
   - organize expanded material into a clear framework
   - decide on form: [brief] (instance) or other detailed structure

4. **refine expression**
   - iterate language, examples, and framing to match clarity and audience needs

5. **finalize**
   - produce the deliverable in the intended scope and form
   - verify alignment with the seed’s intent

---

## 📐 when to use
- when starting from **limited initial input**
- when clarity of scope is critical and drift must be minimized
- when evolving a [title] (reference) into a [brief] (instance)

---

## 💡 notes
- the **seed** serves as a guardrail to prevent irrelevant expansion
- works well with `<distill>` to reverse the process back into a compact seed form
- danger: over-expanding beyond the seed’s intended boundaries — mitigate with regular scope checks
