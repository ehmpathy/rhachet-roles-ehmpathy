ðŸ”¥ [motive] â€” an internal pressure or desire
.what = the underlying reason the actor wants anything at all

.form = emotional, value-driven, often implicit

.examples:
[motive] = avoid failure
[motive] = gain respect
[motive] = feel in control

---

ðŸŽ¯ [intent] â€” a chosen next action
.what = a specific thing the actor plans to do next

.form = short-term, actionable, verb-shaped

.examples:
[intent] = schedule a call
[intent] = submit proposal
[intent] = clean the garage

---

ðŸ¥… [goal] â€” a desired future state
.what = a future outcome the actor wants to reach

.form = long-term, state-shaped, noun/condition

.examples:
[goal] = get more customers
[goal] = have a clean house

ðŸ§  mental model
[motive] = source of pressure
[goal] = destination
[intent] = chosen step toward it

- `[motive]` fuels the journey
- `[goal]` gives it direction
- `[intent]` initiates motion

> every `[intent]` serves a `[goal]`, and every `[goal]` is backed by a `[motive]` â€” but these are not always visible on the surface.
