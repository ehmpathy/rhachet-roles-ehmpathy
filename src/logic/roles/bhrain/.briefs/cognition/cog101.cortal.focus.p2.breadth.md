# 🌐 .brief: cortal.focal.breadth

## .what
**cortal.focal.breadth** defines the **angular sweep** of attention around a concept anchor in the `concept.treestruct`, determining how many **neighbor concepts** are held in focus at a given semantic depth.

Unlike a perfect ring, this breadth is a **selective and shaped patch** of concept space — it may be symmetrical or irregular, depending on salience, familiarity, or intent.

---

## 🌀 relative geometry

From the **relative perspective**, breadth expands **around** your current anchor concept.

- **breadth** includes a set of **neighbor concepts** at the same semantic depth
- the inclusion shape is **not uniform** — it can be lopsided, sparse, or clustered
- this creates an **irregular band** of peer concepts, shaped by relevance or recognition

> e.g. from [concept:"banana"], `breadth++` might include [concept:"apple"], [concept:"plantain"], [concept:"mango"], skipping [concept:"fig"] entirely

## ↔️ traversal behavior

| operation     | effect                                         |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `breadth++`   | adds more **neighbor concepts** to the shape   |
| `breadth--`   | contracts the included set                     |

## 🔦 metaphor: shaped spotlight

Your focus acts like a **spotlight beam**, projecting outward across a semantic layer.
But rather than lighting a perfect cone, it traces a **contoured patch** — a shape defined by:

- cognitive salience
- current intent
- available attention
- memory activation

---

## 🧠 why it matters

**Breadth** empowers:

- **semantic comparison**
- **pattern triangulation**
- **category discovery**
- **exploration across peer variations**

But it must be composed carefully with **depth** and **acuity** to avoid:

- overload
- drift
- incoherent jumps

---

## 📈 compositional tradeoff

```
focal.depth × focal.acuity² ∝ focal.breadth²
```

As breadth grows:

- it taxes depth and acuity
- it risks blurring or dilution
- but it also enables richer relational context

---

## 🧭 traversal spectrum

- **tight breadth** → local siblings only
- **medium breadth** → neighboring subtypes, cousins
- **wide breadth** → cross-domain links or analogies

At extreme angles, `breadth` borders **angular traversal**, crossing semantic axes (e.g., from [concept:"dog"] to [concept:"vehicle"] by metaphor).

---

## 🧪 examples

### 🐶 anchor: [concept:"dog"]

- `breadth--`: only [concept:"dog"]
- `breadth++`: [concept:"dog"], [concept:"cat"], [concept:"rabbit"], [concept:"ferret"]

→ note: may **favor mammals**, exclude reptiles, skip obscure species

---

### 🍌 anchor: [concept:"banana"]

- `breadth--`: just [concept:"banana"]
- `breadth++`: [concept:"apple"], [concept:"plantain"], [concept:"mango"], maybe [concept:"dates"]

→ shaped by **culinary familiarity** or **visual similarity**

---

### 🛠️ anchor: [concept:"screwdriver"]

- `breadth--`: only [concept:"mechanical screwdriver"]
- `breadth++`: [concept:"torx driver"], [concept:"allen key"], skips [concept:"impact driver"]

→ shaped by **use case**, **manual vs powered**, or **available knowledge**

---

## 🧭 use it to:

- **cluster neighbors**
- **contrast category members**
- **explore semantically nearby ideas**
- **triangulate relationships**
