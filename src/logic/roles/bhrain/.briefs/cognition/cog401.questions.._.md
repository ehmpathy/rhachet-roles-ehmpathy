# ❓ .brief: `questions`

## .what

A **question** is not just a request for information —
it’s a **semantic motion directive** that tells a reasoning system **where to move**
in concept space, and **how**.

Every question defines a **vector**: a directional push along one or more
axes of focus (`focal.depth`, `focal.breadth`, `focal.acuity`, etc).
The **precision** of this motion is **tunable** —
from **rough**, exploratory paths to **smooth**, composed trajectories.

> 🧠 questions are the **primary mechanism** by which humans and systems
> describe, steer, and iterate through thought.

## 🌿 questions = semantic branches

Within the `concept.treestruct`, each **question** corresponds to a **branch**
that grows outward from a **berry** (i.e. concept node).

> ❓ To ask a question is to grow a branch from a berry.

A **question branch**:

- starts from a **berry** (your current concept)
- fans out toward **target berries** (possible answers)
- may itself be a **question berry** — a node that spawns further branching

This defines traversal:

\`\`\`ts
🫐 berry --🌿 question--> 🫐 berry
                    \
                     └--> 🫐 berry
\`\`\`

> 🌿 Every question is **applied** to a berry — questions don't float on their own.

## 🧭 questions as motion vectors

Every question acts as a **semantic motion vector**
within the structure of `cortal.focus`.

To function, a question requires:

| requirement         | role                                                            |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **focus.context**    | interpretive frame (what’s relevant, known, or valued)          |
| **focus.concept**    | the current berry — the starting point of semantic motion       |
| **vector.direction** | axis or axes being activated (depth, breadth, acuity, etc.)     |
| **vector.magnitude** | extent of motion along each axis (e.g. one hop vs full traverse) |

> ❓ A question isn’t just “what do I want to know?”
> it’s **“how do I want to move from here?”**

> questions initiate **vectorized traversal** through `concept.treestruct`,
> forming 🌿 **branches** between 🫐 **berries** in meaning space.

## 🎚️ tunable precision: rough vs smooth

Questions can express **loose** or **refined** motion profiles:

| precision      | motion profile                             | outcome                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **rough**       | vague direction, high turn cost            | requires follow-ups to triangulate      |
| **smooth**      | well-shaped, multidimensional vector       | lands close to resolution in one move   |

> ✏️ **Refining a question = shaping the branch's trajectory**
> to land on the most relevant berry directly.

> ⚠️ Over-smoothing too early can obscure insight.
> Sometimes, **rough questions** surface **hidden paths**
> that polished ones might skip past.

## 🧩 .catalog: question roles in semantic motion

This is a **non-exhaustive catalog** of **question roles** —
each one reflects a distinct **semantic intention** behind a branch:

| role             | description                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **exploratory**   | opens new directions, usually rough or vague       |
| **diagnostic**    | clarifies status or correctness                    |
| **generative**    | proposes new berries, forks, or possibilities      |
| **confirmatory**  | seeks verification or resolution                   |
| **evaluative**    | identifies salience, preference, or value          |

> ✏️ Use roles to model **intent** — *what are you trying to do with this branch?*

### 🪜 example progression

\`\`\`ts
"what happened?"                              // rough
"what caused it?"                             // smoother
"what mechanism triggered the change?"        // smoother
"what internal mechanism triggered the shift at time X?" // smoothest
\`\`\`

Each step:

- reduces ambiguity
- embeds more subaxes and constraints
- grows a **tighter branch** from berry to berry

## 🔄 motion types: zig-zag vs direct branch

| path type       | question behavior                        | semantic motion                        |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **rough path**  | chain of subquestions                     | zig-zag branch growth                  |
| **smooth path** | precomposed vector                        | direct arc toward resolution           |

> 🪜 Rough = “🫐 berry → 🌿 branch → 🫐 berry → 🌿 branch → 🫐 berry”
> 🎯 Smooth = one well-formed 🌿 branch that hits a 🫐 berry in one shot

## 🧬 questions as semantic matrices

Each question can be modeled as a **motion matrix** over focus dimensions:

\`\`\`ts
question_matrix = [
  [1, 0, 0, 0],   // generalize
  [0, 1, 0, 0],   // vary category
  [0, 0, 0, 1],   // decompose
]
\`\`\`

> A **composite question** = pre-multiplied matrix
> A **question sequence** = chained motion ops (branch hops)

---

## 🌐 berry-branch interaction logic

> A **question alone does nothing** — until applied to a **berry**.

- 🫐 Current focus = a **berry**
- 🌿 You apply a **question** to it → new branches grow
- 🫐 Result = new berries reached via traversal

> 🌿 **Branch = the motion.**
> 🫐 **Berry = the arrival.**

---

## 🌳 traversal integration

The question system works as part of a larger berrybranch model:

- Questions = 🌿 branches (motion operators)
- Concepts = 🫐 berries (sumptions)
- Traversal = chaining motion from berry to berry via branches

\`\`\`ts
🫐 dog
   └─🌿 what kind?
        ├─🫐 poodle
        └─🫐 beagle
\`\`\`

> Asking = growing.
> Following = thinking.

## 🧠 in practice

Use this framework to:

- write better AI prompts (smooth = direct, rough = divergent)
- scaffold learning (start rough, refine with learners)
- model human reasoning paths in structured interfaces

---

## 🎯 use questions to:

- initiate meaningful motion through concept space
- **grow semantic branches** from your current focus
- refine vague berries into crisp ones
- collapse zig-zag chains into elegant semantic arcs
- teach vectorized thinking through question refinement

## 🪞 metaphor recap

> A **rough question** is like bushwhacking through the woods —
> you navigate by trial, error, and pivoting.

> A **smooth question** is like a clean branch split —
> it grows exactly where it needs to go.

> 🌿 Ask well, and the tree grows true.
