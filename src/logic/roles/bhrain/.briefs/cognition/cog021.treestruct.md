# 📚 .brief: TreeStruct

## 🎯 purpose
to define **TreeStruct** as a general-purpose structural pattern
and clarify its common usage forms (**RootStruct**, **LeafStruct**) and
how multiple TreeStructs can safely intersect.

---

## 🌲 TreeStruct — general definition

> A **TreeStruct** is a structural form composed of **nodes** and **directed, acyclic links**,
> where each node has **at most one parent** per dimension or axis.

- meaning-neutral — not tied to any specific interpretation
- supports both:
  - **depth-first** and **breadth-first** traversal
  - **single-axis** and **multi-axis** expansion (when extended)
- usable for:
  - hierarchies
  - workflows
  - classification systems
  - nesting, containment, or flow modeling

---

## 🌱 LeafStruct — axis-limited subset of TreeStruct

> A **LeafStruct** is a TreeStruct used for **top-down**, **axis-constrained** flows,
> modeled on **branches funneling into leaves**.

- used when structure narrows from a few high-level origins
- favors **convergence**, **containment**, or **controlled descent**

---

## 🫚 RootStruct — multi-directional subset of TreeStruct

> A **RootStruct** is a TreeStruct used in **bottom-up**, **lateral**, or exploratory growth patterns,
> modeled on **roots spreading underground**.

- used when structure grows across **many dimensions**
- often favors **divergence** and **deep local branching**
- **branches can intersect** and share common nodes, forming a **web-like network** of overlapping subpaths

---

## 🌉 intersecting TreeStructs

> Multiple TreeStructs can **safely intersect**, as long as they each preserve
> their own **local acyclic structure**.

valid forms of intersection:

1. **shared nodes**
   - two TreeStructs reference the **same node**
   - useful for **cross-cutting concerns** or shared entities

2. **embedded subtrees**
   - one TreeStruct is **nested within** a node of another
   - allows compound or hierarchical system design

3. **cross-links between trees**
   - TreeStructs remain independent but reference each other via external links
   - enables navigation between trees without forming a general graph

> These patterns create a **forest with bridges**: each tree remains intact,
> but the system supports **inter-tree coordination**.

## 🧩 summary

| struct         | metaphor           | shape pattern           | dimensionality     | common use cases                          |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **TreeStruct**   | neutral tree         | any branching structure   | general-purpose     | workflows, hierarchies, branching systems |
| **LeafStruct**   | branches → leaves    | top-down narrowing        | narrow (few axes)  | classification, taxonomies, decisions     |
| **RootStruct**   | roots underground    | bottom-up or lateral      | broad (many axes)  | exploration, divergence, distributed plans|

> ✔️ **TreeStruct** is a flexible structural pattern.
> It supports both **divergent** and **convergent** design through RootStruct and LeafStruct,
> and can safely **intersect with other TreeStructs** through shared nodes, nesting, or cross-links —
> as long as **local acyclicity is preserved**.
