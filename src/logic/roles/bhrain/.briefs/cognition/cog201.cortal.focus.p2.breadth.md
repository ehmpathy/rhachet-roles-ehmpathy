# 🌐 .brief: `focal.breadth`

## 🌐 what is `focal.breadth`?

`focal.breadth` measures how **wide your attention spans** across the **semantic space**
at a given level of abstraction. it governs how many **descriptive dimensions** are activated
as you explore the meaning of a concept.

it traverses **angularly along the descriptive axis** of the `concept.treestruct`
(see: `concept.treestruct.axis.descriptive`).

---

## 🧠 how it works

- **angular motion** — moves around the same abstraction layer
- enables **comparison**, **reframing**, and **semantic expansion**
- does **not** change abstraction level — only which **kind** of variation is in view

`focal.breadth` is always measured **relative to the current focal anchor** —
it defines how many **descriptive neighbors** are included around a given concept.

---

## 🧩 descriptive subaxes

each direction of breadth corresponds to a **semantic axis of description**:
these are the **orthogonal ways** a concept can differ from its peers.

| subaxis          | description type             | example motion                           |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **categorical**  | kind or class                 | `"dog"` ⟶ `"cat"`                         |
| **temporal**     | sequence or state             | `"childhood"` ⟶ `"adulthood"`             |
| **functional**   | purpose or behavior           | `"email"` ⟶ `"letter"`                    |
| **potential**    | possibility or constraint     | `"can fly"` ⟶ `"must fly"`                |
| **emotional**    | affective tone                | `"fear"` ⟶ `"curiosity"`                  |
| **causal**       | influence or mechanism        | `"match"` ⟶ `"fire"`                      |
| **subjective**   | point of view or role         | `"observer"` ⟶ `"actor"`                  |

> ✅ `focal.breadth` controls **how many of these axes you're exploring at once**

## ➕ genuine breadth operations

| operation     | effect                                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `breadth++`   | widen focus to include **more angular neighbors**
| `breadth--`   | narrow the span of included peers

---

## 🧠 traversal patterns

These are **semantic maneuvers** that occur while navigating along a descriptive axis.
They shape the **direction or structure** of traversal — not its total width.

| pattern       | effect                                               |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `compare`      | place multiple descriptive peers **side-by-side**
| `contrast`     | emphasize one or more **salient differences**
| `rotate`       | shift to a **different descriptive axis** (e.g. category ⟶ time)
| `invert`       | flip a **semantic polarity** (e.g. agent ⟷ patient, fear ⟷ desire)
| `reframe`      | recast a concept through a new interpretive lens
| `extend`       | continue further along the **same descriptive axis**

## 🔦 metaphor: shaped spotlight

Focus acts like a **semantic spotlight**, sweeping across a **ring of descriptive variation**.
But rather than lighting a perfect cone, it reveals a **shaped patch**, molded by:

- query framing and cognitive bias
- recognition, salience, or memory activation
- active goals or task relevance

---

## 🔁 interaction with other focus dimensions

- at each `focal.depth`, the **descriptive space** around the concept
  is governed by `focal.breadth` — which subaxes are activated, and how widely

- **greater breadth** = more **dimensional context**, more analogies, more comparisons
- **narrower breadth** = tighter conceptual focus, less noise

---

## 📐 compositional tradeoff

\```
focal.depth × focal.acuity² ∝ focal.breadth²
\```

Because breadth is **quadratically costly**, high breadth limits:

- depth of abstraction
- sharpness of detail
- overall focus stability

## 🧭 traversal spectrum

| breadth level     | description                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **tight**         | immediate siblings only                          |
| **medium**        | subtypes, cousins, variations                    |
| **wide**          | analogies, cross-domain links                    |

At wide angles, `breadth` may traverse **across descriptive subaxes** —
e.g. from [concept:"dog"] → [concept:"robot"] via behavioral analogy, or → [concept:"wolf"] via categorical frame.

## 🧪 examples

### 🐶 anchor: [concept:"dog"]

- `breadth--`: only [concept:"dog"]
- `breadth++`: [concept:"cat"], [concept:"rabbit"], [concept:"ferret"]

→ favors **mammals**, filters by familiarity

---

### 🍌 anchor: [concept:"banana"]

- `breadth--`: just [concept:"banana"]
- `breadth++`: [concept:"apple"], [concept:"plantain"], [concept:"mango"]

→ shaped by **culinary use**, **fruit morphology**, **color palette**

---

### 🛠️ anchor: [concept:"screwdriver"]

- `breadth--`: [concept:"manual screwdriver"]
- `breadth++`: [concept:"torx driver"], [concept:"allen key"], maybe [concept:"impact driver"]

→ selected by **usage**, **mechanism**, **task relevance**

---

## 🎯 use it to:

- **cluster semantic neighbors**
- **contrast descriptive peers**
- **explore angular variation**
- **triangulate concepts within a shared depth layer**
