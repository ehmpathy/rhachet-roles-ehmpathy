# üß≠ .brief: `physics.vector`

## .what
A **physics vector** is a mathematical object used to represent **quantities that have both magnitude and direction** in physical space.
It also functions as a **data structure** ‚Äî encoding directionally relevant information for computation, simulation, and modeling.

## üß© structure

A vector is defined by:

- **magnitude** ‚Üí the scalar size of the quantity
- **direction** ‚Üí the orientation in space
- **components** ‚Üí projections along basis axes (e.g. `x`, `y`, `z`)
  - written as `v = ‚ü®vx, vy, vz‚ü©` or `v = vx‚ÄØiÃÇ + vy‚ÄØjÃÇ + vz‚ÄØkÃÇ`

## üß† examples of vector quantities

| quantity         | description                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **velocity**     | speed + direction of motion                 |
| **acceleration** | rate of change of velocity (directional)    |
| **force**        | push or pull with a direction               |
| **momentum**     | mass √ó velocity                             |
| **electric field** | directional force on a unit charge        |

## üîß operations on vectors

| operation             | meaning                                             |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **addition**          | combine vectors tip-to-tail                         |
| **subtraction**       | find relative vector between two                   |
| **scalar multiplication** | scales magnitude, keeps direction            |
| **dot product**       | projects one vector onto another (returns scalar)   |
| **cross product**     | finds perpendicular vector (returns vector)         |

## üìê geometric interpretation

Vectors live in a **Euclidean space** (‚Ñù¬≤, ‚Ñù¬≥) and can be visualized as **arrows**:

- **length** of arrow = magnitude
- **angle** = direction relative to axes
- operations map to geometric rules (e.g. triangle or parallelogram rule)

## üßÆ as a data structure

In computational systems, a vector is a **structured container of values**, optimized for directional computation:

| property           | value                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **type**           | `Vector` or `Array<number>`                |
| **arity**          | dimensionality (e.g. 2D, 3D, nD)            |
| **shape**          | fixed-length tuple of scalars              |
| **indexing**       | ordered (e.g. `[0] = x`, `[1] = y`)        |
| **mutability**     | may be mutable (runtime), or immutable     |

Vectors are frequently implemented as:

\`\`\`ts
type Vector3 = [number, number, number]
\`\`\`

or with named accessors:

\`\`\`ts
interface Vector3 {
  x: number
  y: number
  z: number
}
\`\`\`

This enables:

- direct algebraic operations (`add`, `dot`, `normalize`, etc.)
- efficient storage (especially in graphics, physics engines)
- compatibility with matrix operations and coordinate transforms

## ‚ö†Ô∏è important distinctions

- Vectors ‚â† scalars ‚Äî direction matters
- Coordinate representation is **basis-relative**
- The vector itself is **basis-invariant**

## üß¨ advanced notes

- In relativity: vectors generalize to **4-vectors** (e.g. spacetime)
- In field theory: **vector fields** assign a vector to each point in space
- In curved space: vectors live in **tangent spaces** and obey **manifold** rules
- In graphics and physics engines: vectors are core data primitives ‚Äî enabling transforms, simulations, and animations

| perspective     | usage                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **physical**     | represents real-world directional quantity |
