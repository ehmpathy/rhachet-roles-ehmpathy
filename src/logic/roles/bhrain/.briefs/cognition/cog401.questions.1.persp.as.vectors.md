# ❓ .brief: `questions.as.motion.vectors`

## .what

In structured thought, a **question** is not just a request for information —
it's a **semantic motion vector**: a directive that specifies **where to move**
in concept space, and **how**.

Each question encodes **both a direction and magnitude** of conceptual motion,
targeting one or more subaxes of `cortal.focus` with varying intensities.

## 🧠 as vector behavior

| component          | role                                                       |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **axis selector**   | identifies which semantic dimension to activate           |
| **scalar magnitude**| controls how far to move (depth, acuity, breadth)         |
| **multi-axis blend**| combines motions across multiple subaxes simultaneously   |
| **origin anchor**   | defines the context/starting concept for traversal        |

## 🧭 question as motion directive

A single question may:

- refine a **single subaxis** → “What color is it?” → `focal.breadth.categorical++`
- trigger a **depth shift** → “What kind of fruit is it?” → `focal.depth.instantiate`
- increase **acuity** → “What traits make this effective?” → `focal.acuity.attributes++`
- combine multiple → “Why does it work better than the alternative?”
  → rotate axis + articulate traits + causal generalization

## 🧬 questions as matrix operations

> 🧩 a **set of questions** can be treated as a **semantic transformation matrix**
> — each row targeting a subaxis, each column encoding vector weights.

\`\`\`ts
// conceptual state vector = [depth, breadth.axis1, breadth.axis2, acuity.substructs, ...]
question_matrix = [
  [1, 0, 0, 0],   // generalize
  [0, 1, 0, 0],   // vary categorical
  [0, 0, 0, 1],   // decompose
]

result = apply(question_matrix, current_focus)
\`\`\`

> this lets reasoning behave like a **steered transform** —
> question structure becomes the guidance system for mental motion.

## 🪞 metaphor

> a question is a **steering vector** —
> not just "what you want to know", but **where you want to go**.

- it activates a **direction** in the concept space
- it scales the **intensity** of traversal
- it constrains **which dimensions** are in play

## 🎯 use this idea when:

- modeling structured reasoning or "tree-of-thought"
- composing AI agents that interpret or chain questions
- designing semantic UX interfaces where prompts guide concept shifts
- tracing how a question shifts focus across multiple axes
