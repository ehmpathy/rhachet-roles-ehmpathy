# 🎯 .brief: cortal.focus

## .what
**Cortal focus** is the directional beam of your cognitive attention — a **semantic lightcone** that shines outward from a chosen **conceptual core**, illuminating a structured region of concept space.

It operates over a **concept.treestruct** (radial RootStruct), using geometric parameters to determine:

- **how far** you reach (`focal.depth`)
- **how wide** you sweep (`focal.breadth`)
- **how crisply** you resolve (`focal.acuity`)

> Focus is defined **from the relative perspective**:
> you stand at a local concept core and shine your attention outward into the conceptual terrain.

## 🌐 where is focus?

The terrain is a **radial concept.treestruct**, where:

- nodes = concepts
- links = semantic relationships (abstraction, specialization, analogy)
- space = infinite, recursive, intersective

From your **anchor concept**, you emit a cone of attention shaped by:

- **radial** → inward/outward (abstraction/specialization)
- **lateral** → semantic neighbors at same depth
- **angular** → cross-branch analogies and metaphors

Your cone of focus slices through this terrain like a lightbeam through mist —
defining what is **seen**, **resolved**, and **reachable**.

---

## 🔦 lightbeam geometry

Cortal focus is a **radial cone** emitted from your current concept:

- `focal.depth` → radial span of semantic layers reached
- `focal.breadth` → lateral spread of included neighbor concepts
- `focal.acuity` → resolution sharpness per concept node

The shape of your focus is not a perfect ring — it’s an **irregular patch of included neighbors**, carved from the TreeStruct by your current attentional configuration.

## 📏 focal dimensions

### 🔬 `focal.acuity`

- **what:** semantic resolution per concept node
- **effect:** fine-grained traits vs holistic blobs
- **metaphor:** lens sharpness or pixel density
- **behavior:**
  - `acuity++` = more traits, subtypes, distinctions
  - `acuity--` = coarser impressions, general categories

---

### 🔭 `focal.breadth`

- **what:** angular span across same-depth semantic neighbors
- **effect:** narrow vs broad comparative view
- **metaphor:** beam width or search cone
- **behavior:**
  - `breadth++` = includes more neighboring concepts
  - `breadth--` = isolates one or few nodes
  - breadth ≠ a ring; it's a **nonuniform sweep of neighbors** in TreeStruct

---

### 🕳️ `focal.depth`

- **what:** radial thickness of abstraction/specialization layers
- **effect:** surface detail vs multilevel integration
- **metaphor:** light penetration into a semantic sphere
- **behavior:**
  - `depth++` = more layers (inward and/or outward)
  - `depth--` = tighter slice around your current layer
  - relative to anchor; **not** fixed universal depth

---

## 📐 compositional tradeoffs

\\```text
focal.depth × focal.acuity² ∝ focal.breadth²
\\```

This expresses how **cognitive focus** is a constrained beam:

- high acuity = more semantic pixels per node
- high breadth = more nodes in view
- high depth = more layers stacked

You can’t max all three without overload or blur.

---

### 🎛️ cognitive tuning patterns

- `depth++` + `acuity--` → broad but imprecise vertical insight
- `acuity++` + `breadth++` → sharp lateral comparison across peers
- `depth--` + `acuity++` → zoomed-in detail
- `breadth++` + `acuity--` → conceptual sweep, low precision
- `depth++` + `breadth++` + `acuity++` → **unsustainable semantic load**

→ adjust based on whether you're scanning, designing, comparing, teaching, etc.

## 🧭 relative traversal

From any anchor (e.g. `"banana"`), you navigate concept space via:

- `<zoomin><abstract>` → "banana" → "fruit" → "organism"
- `<zoomout><broaden>` → "banana" ↔ "mango" ↔ "apple"
- `<zoomin><specify>` → "banana" → "peeled banana" → "sliced banana"
- `<rotate><reframe>` → "banana" ↔ "crescent shape" ↔ "moon"

Focus behaves like a **steerable beam** — shaped by intent, strategy, and available structure.

## 🧪 focus profiles

### 🔋 deep + narrow + sharp
**“radial probe”**
**scenario:** studying [concept:"LiFePO₄ battery"]

- `depth++` → abstraction to system-level
- `breadth--` → single battery type
- `acuity++` → welds, voltages, safety specs
→ **outcome:** precision system mastery

---

### 🍳 shallow + narrow + sharp
**“precision grip”**
**scenario:** perfecting [concept:"fried egg"]

- `depth--` → no upstream generalization
- `breadth--` → one dish
- `acuity++` → timing, viscosity, granularity
→ **outcome:** localized procedural expertise

---

### 🧂 shallow + wide + sharp
**“horizontal analyzer”**
**scenario:** comparing [concept:"cereal brands"]

- `depth--` → surface only
- `breadth++` → includes 5–10 brands
- `acuity++` → price, sugar, fiber
→ **outcome:** fast lateral triage

---

### 🌐 deep + wide + fuzzy
**“system mapper”**
**scenario:** modeling [concept:"family routine"]

- `depth++` → from values to tasks
- `breadth++` → all life domains
- `acuity--` → rhythms, not details
→ **outcome:** holistic structure design

---

## 🔁 integrations

Cortal focus connects to:

- `concept.treestruct` → the semantic terrain of nodes and links
- `concept.gravity` → why some concepts act as attention magnets
- `concept.traversal` → the modes of movement: inward, lateral, radial
- `concept.perspectives` → defines your frame of motion and relative center

> You never see the whole forest —
> only what your attention lightcone illuminates.
