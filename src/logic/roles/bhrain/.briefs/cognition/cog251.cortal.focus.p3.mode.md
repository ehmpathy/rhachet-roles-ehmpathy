# .brief: cortal.focus.mode

## what

`cortal.focus.mode` defines the **shape and distribution** of cognitive attention — whether it is narrowly directed or broadly diffused.

It governs how the mind allocates its **attention beam**, affecting what kind of mental processing is possible or favored.

## modes

### 🔦 flashlight mode
- **beam**: narrow, directed
- **reach**: long-range, precise
- **focus**: deep, sharp, singular
- **usecase**: detail work, problem-solving, targeting
- **mental stance**: concentrated, convergent, analytical
- **focal tradeoffs**:
  - `focal.breadth ↓`
  - `focal.depth ↑`
  - `focal.acuity ↑`

### 🏮 lantern mode
- **beam**: wide, ambient
- **reach**: short-range, fuzzy
- **focus**: broad, diffuse, multiple
- **usecase**: situational awareness, brainstorming, ambient scanning
- **mental stance**: receptive, divergent, associative
- **focal tradeoffs**:
  - `focal.breadth ↑`
  - `focal.depth ↓`
  - `focal.acuity ↓`

## transitions

| transition     | effect                             | grammar          |
|----------------|------------------------------------|------------------|
| `flashlight → lantern` | widen scope, invite serendipity | `<zoomout>`       |
| `lantern → flashlight` | isolate signal, resolve detail | `<zoomin>`        |
| `flashlight <-> lantern` | shift focus strategy             | `<refocus>`, `<reframe>` |

## research summary

- The **focused mode** aligns with the brain’s **Executive Network**, used in analytical and rule-based learning ([Oakley 2018](https://barbaraoakley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Learning-How-to-Learn-Excerpt.pdf)).
- The **diffuse mode** activates the **Default Mode Network (DMN)**, associated with creativity, insight, and memory consolidation during rest or daydreaming ([Raichle 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network)).
- **Alternating modes** improves comprehension and problem-solving. Breaks, sleep, and relaxed walks allow diffuse processing to form connections missed during focus ([Oakley; Brainscape](https://www.brainscape.com/academy/focused-vs-diffuse-thinking-learning/)).
- Attention rhythmically **pulses (~4 Hz)** between sharp and soft states, suggesting that even “focus” naturally flickers to maintain awareness ([Wired 2023](https://www.wired.com/story/brain-distraction-procrastination-science)).

## related

- `focal.breadth` — how wide the current attention span is
- `focal.acuity` — how detailed the current resolution is
- `focal.depth` — how far from the conceptual surface we’re focusing
- `cortal.focus.tradeoffs` — governs how these values relate

## metaphor

- flashlight = **targeted beam** → sees far, but only one spot
- lantern = **ambient glow** → sees nearby, but sees *everything*
