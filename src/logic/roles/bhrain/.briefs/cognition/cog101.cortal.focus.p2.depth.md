# 🕳️ .brief: cortal.focal.depth

## .what
**cortal.focal.depth** defines the **radial thickness** of semantic layers surrounding a concept, measured within the `concept.treestruct` from a **relative anchor**.

It reflects how many layers of meaning — both more abstract and more specific — are simultaneously in view, relative to the current center of thought.

---

## 📐 relative geometry

In the **relative perspective**, attention radiates outward from an anchor concept — forming a **radial shell** through the surrounding concept space:

- `focal.depth` defines **how thick** that shell is
- traversal still follows **universal abstraction**:
  - **inward** = more abstract
  - **outward** = more specific
- but the **frame of reference** is **local**:
  - depth is measured “**around**” the anchor

> from [concept:"banana"], a thick depth might include [concept:"fruit"] (inward) and [concept:"plantain"] (outward)

---

## 🔦 metaphor: beam of attention

Imagine a **beam of focus** radiating from your current anchor:

- it slices through surrounding layers of the TreeStruct
- the **thickness** of that slice is `focal.depth`
- one direction reaches **inward** toward abstraction
- the other moves **outward** toward specialization

This beam defines which semantic layers are cognitively lit up — and how far in both directions your reasoning stretches.

---

## ↕️ directional behavior (universal semantics)

```
depth.inward++   → include more abstract concepts
depth.outward++  → include more specific concepts
depth.inward--   → trim inner abstraction
depth.outward--  → trim edge specificity
```

These movements are **semantic**, not spatial — they follow the **universal axis of abstraction** regardless of your anchor point.

## 📊 thickness vs precision

- `depth++` → more layers included
- `depth--` → thinner slice around anchor

Choose based on your cognitive goal:

| Use Case                  | Strategy                         |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Pattern → implementation  | `depth++` for vertical span      |
| Local precision task      | `depth--` for focus              |
| Core essence only         | `depth.inward--`                 |
| Fine-grain edge only      | `depth.outward--`                |

## 📈 compositional interaction

```
focal.depth × focal.acuity² ∝ focal.breadth²
```

This geometric relation constrains focus:

- the deeper your shell, the finer your acuity must be reduced to maintain clarity across a wide breadth
- you can’t go **deep, wide, and sharp** all at once — without tradeoffs

## 🧠 examples

### 🐶 anchor: [concept:"dog"]

- `depth.inward++`:
  [concept:"mammal"] → [concept:"animal"] → [concept:"organism"]
- `depth.outward++`:
  [concept:"golden retriever"] → [concept:"service retriever"] → [concept:"autism-assist retriever"]

---

### 🛠️ anchor: [concept:"hammer"]

- `depth.inward++`:
  [concept:"hand tool"] → [concept:"manual implement"] → [concept:"mechanical device"]
- `depth.outward++`:
  [concept:"claw hammer"] → [concept:"rubber-handled claw hammer"] → [concept:"ergonomic demolition hammer"]

---

## 🧰 radial composition behavior

```
focal.depth++
⇒ depth.inward++ && depth.outward++
⇒ [concept:"dog"] ←→ [concept:"autism-assist retriever"]
```

```
focal.depth--
⇒ depth.inward-- && depth.outward--
⇒ only [concept:"dog"]
```

## 🧭 use when you need:

- **multilevel semantic perspective**
- **vertical reasoning chains**
- **semantic scaffolding**
- **narrative abstraction control**
