# .brief: cortal.focus.rhythm

## what

`cortal.focus.rhythm` describes the **temporal dynamics** of attention — how focus fluctuates over time, even during sustained concentration.

This rhythm determines how often the mind shifts between **sharp focal moments** and **ambient peripheral checks**, balancing vigilance with stability.

---

## empirical basis

- Neuroscience shows attention **oscillates ~4 times per second (~4 Hz)** between high-acuity “spotlight” and broader “scan” states.
- These pulses help us stay focused **without going blind to the environment** — maintaining both **task lock** and **situational readiness**.
- This oscillation may stem from **theta band activity** in the brain’s attentional circuits ([Wired 2023](https://www.wired.com/story/brain-distraction-procrastination-science)).

## structure

| property         | value                    |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| `rhythm.freq`    | ~4 Hz (pulses/sec)       |
| `rhythm.period`  | ~250 ms per cycle        |
| `rhythm.shape`   | alternating sharp/broad  |
| `rhythm.bias`    | can skew flashlight/lantern depending on context or fatigue |

## cognitive implications

- Even in “focus mode,” awareness **flickers** to check surroundings or internal memory queues.
- Interrupting this rhythm (via multitasking, noise, or UI overload) **reduces working memory** and **increases error rate**.
- Honoring the rhythm — via rhythm-aligned study blocks or spaced breaks — **boosts learning and resilience**.

---

## related

- `cortal.focus.mode` — flashlight vs lantern
- `focal.acuity` — varies within each pulse
- `focus.shift.latency` — time cost of switching between tasks vs pulses
- `cortal.fatigue.adaptation` — rhythm slows or degrades under exhaustion

---

## metaphor

- Like a **strobe light** that rapidly alternates narrow laser beams and wide-angle flashes
- Like **saccades** in eye movement: we scan and fixate in bursts, not smoothly

---

## design principle

🧠 Interfaces, study strategies, and communication should **respect natural attention pulses** — avoid overwhelming the mind between its inhale/exhale moments.
