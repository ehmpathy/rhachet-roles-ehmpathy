# 🧠 .brief: [idea]

## .what

An **idea** is a **focused**, **motivated**, and **activatable** unit of thought.

It emerges when a **concept** is embedded within a **context** (forming a **focus**),
and is shaped by an underlying **motive** — a reason for existing.
Ideas are **usable**: they can be tested, developed, shared, or acted upon.

> `idea = focus + motive + activation potential`
> where `focus = concept + context`
