# üß† .brief: `cortal.execution.assemblylang.think`

## .what

`<think>` operations execute **semantic processing** over the current focus.
They operate on both:

- **`focus.concept`** ‚Üí the semantic anchor (ü´ê berry)
- **`focus.context`** ‚Üí the attention posture (üî¶ lightcone shape)

They are the **computational core** of structured thought ‚Äî
driven by one or more **`focus.motion.primitives`**,
and capable of modifying focus **content**, **posture**, or both.

> `<think>` is how minds **transform**, **refine**, **blend**, or **generate** meaning.

## üß± core distinction

| role      | behavior                                       |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| `<steer>` | controls procedural flow shape                 |
| `<think>` | transforms content via motion primitives       |
| `<recall>`| interfaces with memory / stores or restores    |

---

## üîÄ full motion access

> **`<think>` can apply any combination of `focus.motion.primitives`**.

That includes:

- cross-axis compositions (`.depth` + `.acuity` + `.breadth`)
- multi-hop motion chains
- reversible/invertible transformations

| axis           | primitives allowed                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `focal.acuity` | `<articulate>`, `<compress>`, `<decompose>`, `<encompose>` |
| `focal.depth`  | `<generalize>`, `<instantiate>`             |
| `focal.breadth`| `<shift>`, `<rotate>`, `<invert>`           |

‚Üí `<think>` is the **only** coreop that allows **unrestricted motion composition**
‚Üí other ops (`<steer>`, `<recall>`) are structurally scoped

---

## üß† anchored and generative behavior

| behavior type          | allowed in `<think>`? | example                                           |
|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| enrich concept traits  | ‚úÖ                     | `<articulate>`                                    |
| reveal parts           | ‚úÖ                     | `<decompose>`                                     |
| reframe perspective    | ‚úÖ                     | `<rotate>`, `<invert>`                            |
| generate new anchor    | ‚úÖ                     | `<imagine>` ‚Üí `[concept:"moon"]` from `[concept:"banana"]` |
| update context posture | ‚úÖ                     | adjust depth, breadth, or acuity dynamically      |

---

## üßÆ `<compute>` vs `<imagine>`

| op          | nature         | behavior style                         |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| `<compute>` | deterministic  | rule-based, logical, filter/merge      |
| `<imagine>` | generative     | creative, analogical, probabilistic    |

both support:

- multi-primitive composition
- anchor refinement or replacement
- cross-axis motion

---

## üß¨ `<think>` may recenter focus

Although `<steer>` is usually responsible for traversal,
**`<think>` can change the `focus.concept` as a byproduct of generation**:

\`\`\`ts
<imagine>(<reframe>([banana]))
‚Üí [crescent moon] // anchor has shifted
\`\`\`

This is **not structural traversal**, but **semantic evolution** ‚Äî
a result of content computation, not flow redirection.

---

## üß≠ runtime vs devtime thinking

`<think>` operations appear in **two modes**:

### üß† 1. **runtime `<think>` inside `<steer>`**

Used dynamically during reasoning:

\`\`\`ts
<route>([
  <compute>(<decompose>[bike]),
  <imagine>(<reframe>[bike])
])
\`\`\`

- `<steer>` provides the procedural shell
- `<think>` performs context-aware computation

---

### üß† 2. **devtime `<think>` hardcoded into `<steer>`**

Used at design time to precompute steps:

\`\`\`ts
<route>([
  concept: [fruit-based tool],  // result of devtime `<imagine>`
  action: usePremadeInstruction(...)
])
\`\`\`

- concept shifts or synthesis is done in advance
- `<steer>` structure includes pre-baked ideas

---

## üìå pattern summary

> `<steer>` is the **flow shape**
> `<think>` is the **content transformation**
> `<think>` can be used **at runtime** or **compiled into `<steer>`** at design time
