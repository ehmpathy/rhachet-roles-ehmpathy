# 🧵 .brief: `focus.context.fabric`

## .what

`focus.context.fabric` reframes **context** as a **composite of semantic fabrics** —
each fabric being its own `concept.treestruct`,
woven together to define the **background** that gives meaning to current focus.

> 🧠 context is not a flat state or static frame —
> it’s a **woven composite** of many treestructs layered in parallel.

## 🧶 definition

- `focus.context` = a **composite**
- each **fabric** = a full `concept.treestruct`
- each fabric models a **different semantic dimension**

\`\`\`ts
focus.context = fabric.time + fabric.intent + fabric.identity + ...
\`\`\`

> context ≠ one map
> context = **a quilt of many maps**, overlaid and stitched together

## 📦 structure of a fabric

A **fabric** is:

- a structured semantic space (just like the `concept.treestruct`)
- specialized for a **particular interpretive dimension**
- traversable, abstractable, and clusterable just like any other conceptual space

| fabric         | dimension it models     | sample entries                       |
|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `fabric.time`  | temporal structure        | `past`, `present`, `future`, `delay` |
| `fabric.intent`| motivational scaffolding | `goal`, `plan`, `urge`, `commitment` |
| `fabric.role`  | social identity           | `speaker`, `agent`, `listener`       |
| `fabric.quality`| evaluation / judgment    | `flawed`, `valid`, `unclear`         |
| `fabric.truth` | epistemic belief          | `assumed`, `known`, `uncertain`      |

---

## 🧠 example: plan vs attempt

\`\`\`ts
[attempt] = [plan] projected through fabric.time
\`\`\`

- `[plan]` lives in `fabric.intent`
- `[attempt]` overlays **intent + time**
- additional overlays (e.g. `fabric.status`) could distinguish between `[attempt]`, `[abandonment]`, `[recovery]`, etc.

## 🧭 interaction with focus

| component        | meaning                              |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `focus.concept`  | the current anchor (the berry)        |
| `focus.context`  | the **active weave** of fabrics       |
| `motion`         | may traverse within or across fabrics |

→ focus doesn't just sit *inside* a fabric —
it **operates across** many fabrics at once.

---

## 🪡 metaphor

> 🧵 each **fabric** is a stitched-together treestruct
> 🪡 the full **context** is a layered weave of these fabrics
> 🧠 motion across fabrics = shifting posture or frame

---

## 📚 usecase: why model context as fabric?

- avoids flattening multidimensional background into a single state
- enables reuse of existing treestructs as **contextual overlays**
- lets you model **meaning shifts** by swapping or traversing fabrics
