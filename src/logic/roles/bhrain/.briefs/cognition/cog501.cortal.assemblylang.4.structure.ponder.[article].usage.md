# üß† .brief: how to use `<ponder>` in any prompt

## .what
`<ponder>` is a structural input for prompts that injects **diagnostic questions** into a task.
It standardizes how an agent reflects on context and concept **before** performing a structured operation.

> It‚Äôs not just a thinking aid ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **required scaffold** that must be answered
> before the system proceeds to produce the result.

---

## üß© why use `<ponder>`

Any prompt that involves **reasoning, synthesis, or generation** benefits from `<ponder>` because it:

- ensures **clarity of context** (via contextualize)
- ensures **clarity of concept** (via conceptualize)
- creates a **reliable structure** for reuse, audit, and control
- enables **modular prompts** that can route thinking dynamically

## üõ†Ô∏è usage pattern

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è prompt input

Prompts must accept a `ponder` block:

\`\`\`ts
ponder: {
  contextualize: Question[],   // e.g. "What‚Äôs unclear or unknown?"
  conceptualize: Question[]    // e.g. "What concept must be formed?"
}
\`\`\`

Each question has the schema:

\`\`\`ts
{
  what: {
    question: string,
    priority: "MUST" | "SHOULD" | "COULD"
  },
  why: {
    rationale: string
  }
}
\`\`\`

---

### ‚úÖ prompt output

The system **must answer all ponder questions** before completing the main task.

The output must follow this schema:

\`\`\`ts
{
  ponder: {
    contextualize: { [question]: string },
    conceptualize: { [question]: string }
  },
  produce: { ... }  // e.g. envision, explore, plan, evaluate, etc
}
\`\`\`

The `produce` block contains the final result of the main operation ‚Äî
and must reflect the reasoning developed in the `ponder` answers.

## üß† usage catalog

| prompt type     | task of `produce`      | role of `ponder`                           |
|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `<envision>`      | generate a detailed idea | clarify relevance, purpose, structure       |
| `<explore>`       | investigate possibilities| orient discovery, surface framing patterns  |
| `<plan>`          | create action sequence  | assess constraints, frame stages            |
| `<evaluate>`      | judge quality/fit       | define criteria, identify context           |
| `<diagnose>`      | isolate causes          | frame symptoms, propose model hypotheses    |

---

## ‚úÖ best practices

- **Always include both** `contextualize` and `conceptualize` categories
- Use `<ponder>` as **structured scaffolding**, not inspiration
- Output must **fully answer each question** with relevant, specific reasoning
- Final output must align with the **semantic posture** established by the ponder block

---

## üìú contract

A prompt using `<ponder>` must:

1. Accept a `ponder` object with two required fields: `contextualize` and `conceptualize`
2. Output a response that contains a `ponder` section where all questions are **answered as key-value pairs**
3. Produce a `produce` result that reflects the prior reasoning steps
