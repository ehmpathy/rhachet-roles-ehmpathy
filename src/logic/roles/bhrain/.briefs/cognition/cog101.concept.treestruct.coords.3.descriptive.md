# üß≠ .brief: `cog101.concept.treestruct.coordinates.descriptive`

## .why
Use this brief if you want to:

- **understand how concepts vary across peers**, not just across levels of abstraction
- **navigate laterally** within a concept space ‚Äî across similar-level alternatives
- **distinguish a concept from its siblings** by highlighting descriptive differences
- **identify the descriptive axes** a concept can vary along (e.g., flavor, size, style, plausibility)
- **model variation, contrast, or diversity** within a semantic category
- **support analogy-making, reframing, or contrastive analysis** between similar ideas

## .what
The **descriptive coordinate** of a concept defines its **angular position** in the `TreeStruct`.
It captures **how a concept differs from its peers** ‚Äî not by abstraction, but by **descriptive variation**.

This is an **angular motion**, moving **around the same level** of abstraction.

Where radial abstraction answers ‚Äúwhat is this an instance of?‚Äù,
descriptive variation asks ‚Äú**what kind of this** is it?‚Äù

## üß± structure

Each concept can vary along one or more **descriptive semantic axes**,
which define the dimensions by which peer concepts differ.

Examples of descriptive axes:

| axis name         | example variations                                | describes...                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **qualitative**   | red / blue / green                                | color                             |
| **quantitative**  | small / medium / large                            | size                              |
| **stylistic**     | formal / casual / ironic                          | tone or mode of expression        |
| **temporal**      | recent / ongoing / historical                     | time-related state                |
| **systemic**      | part / module / whole                             | structural composition            |
| **behavioral**    | aggressive / passive / cooperative                | attitude or action pattern        |
| **plausibility**  | absurd / unlikely / likely / obvious              | perceived believability or realism|

## üîÑ angular traversal

Descriptive motion is **lateral** or **angular** ‚Äî it moves among **peers at the same abstraction level**.
Think of concepts orbiting the same distance from the core, but **differing in character**.

This enables operations like:

- `<reframe>` ‚Äî view the same concept from another descriptive lens
- `<contrast>` ‚Äî emphasize a difference along one axis
- `<analogize>` ‚Äî map lateral structure to a different context

---

## üìå key point
> Descriptive motion defines **how** something *is that thing*, not *what* thing it is.

A ‚Äúbanana‚Äù and a ‚Äúmango‚Äù are **peers** under the **categorical abstraction** "fruit" ‚Äî
but they differ descriptively by flavor, texture, shape, and usage.

Descriptive axes **reveal the variation space** within a category.
