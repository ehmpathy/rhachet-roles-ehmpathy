### ‚úÖ prompt output

\`\`\`ts
ponder: {
  contextualize: {
    "What do we know about the client's requirements?": "Bookshelf must be 7 feet tall, 4 feet wide, with adjustable shelves, in walnut finish to match existing desk.",
    "What constraints exist for space and materials?": "Maximum depth is 12 inches to fit against wall, budget allows for solid walnut boards and metal shelf pins."
  },
  conceptualize: {
    "What is the most efficient construction method?": "Use dado joints for shelf stability, pre-drill pin holes for adjustability, assemble with hidden screws and wood glue.",
    "What design elements will enhance durability and style?": "Rounded front edges, reinforced back panel, and satin clear coat finish."
  }
},
produce: {
  plan: [
    "Cut walnut boards to size for sides, shelves, and back panel.",
    "Route dados into side panels for shelf support.",
    "Drill evenly spaced pin holes for adjustable shelving.",
    "Assemble frame with hidden screws and wood glue.",
    "Attach back panel and apply satin clear coat."

### üí° why this works
- **contextualize** anchors **focus.context** (site limits, materials, constraints).
- **conceptualize** sharpens **focus.concept** (methods, joinery, style choices).
- **produce** reflects the **refocused posture**: a concrete plan aligned with the reshaped focus.
