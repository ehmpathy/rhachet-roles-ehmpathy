# 🔬 .brief: `cortal.focal.acuity`

## .what
**cortal.focal.acuity** governs the **semantic resolution** of each concept in focus —
how **granular**, **precisely attributed**, and **internally resolved** the concept representation is.

It determines how much **inner detail** your focus resolves per concept node within the spherical `concept.treestruct`.

---

## 🧠 how it works

Acuity controls resolution across **two semantic layers**:

- `.attributes` — surface traits, labels, and descriptive features
- `.substructs` — internal parts, components, or embedded structures

Both can be modulated independently or jointly depending on the task.

#### acuity scale:

- `acuity++` → high resolution
  - many dimensions resolved: features, internals, edge cases
  - e.g. for [concept:"hammer"]:
    - `.attributes`: `head.mass`, `handle.material`, `grip.type`
    - `.substructs`: `core.fusion`, `shock.channeling.structure`

- `acuity--` → low resolution
  - coarse, holistic representations
  - e.g. just “thing you hit with”

Acuity operates **independently** of:
- `focal.depth`: how many layers of abstraction are included
- `focal.breadth`: how many peer concepts are viewed

---

## 🔦 metaphor: optical focus

- high acuity = **sharp lens**
  - captures semantic edges, traits, and inner systems
  - like increasing megapixels on a single node

- low acuity = **blurry filter**
  - sees general shape, label, or purpose
  - useful for rapid categorization or zoomed-out navigation

---

## 📐 composition tradeoff

\```
focal.depth × focal.acuity² ∝ focal.breadth²
\```

Because acuity is squared, it's **computationally expensive** —
high acuity demands either larger breadth or shallower depth to avoid overload.

## 🧪 examples

### 🐶 [concept:"dog"]

- `acuity--`: “a furry animal that barks”
- `acuity++`:
  - `.attributes`: `breed.type`, `coat.pattern`, `jaw.structure`
  - `.substructs`: `muscle.groups`, `nervous.pathways`, `behavior.protocols`

---

### 🔋 [concept:"battery"]

- `acuity--`: “thing that stores energy”
- `acuity++`:
  - `.attributes`: `form.factor`, `charge.curve`, `voltage.stability`
  - `.substructs`: `anode.stack`, `electrolyte.channel`, `thermal.fuse.logic`

---

### 🪚 [concept:"handsaw"]

- `acuity--`: “tool for cutting”
- `acuity++`:
  - `.attributes`: `tooth.pitch`, `blade.length`, `grip.material`
  - `.substructs`: `core.flex.strata`, `fastener.joints`, `multi-bevel.edge`

---

## 🎯 why acuity matters

High acuity enables:

- **precise design and modeling**
- **deep diagnosis and troubleshooting**
- **attribute-based comparison or distinction**

Low acuity supports:

- **rapid categorization**
- **abstract reasoning and compression**
- **broad or shallow semantic navigation**

---

## 🔁 dynamic behavior

Acuity is often **modulated during traversal**:

- zoom in = `acuity++` to analyze traits and internals
- zoom out = `acuity--` to generalize or jump layers

It can also **vary per node**:
- some neighbors are sharp and detailed
- others remain fuzzy or holistically interpreted

---

## ⚠️ caution: over-acuity

Overfocusing can lead to:

- irrelevant micromanagement
- detail overload
- failure to generalize

Use acuity **intentionally** — zoom in with purpose, zoom out with perspective.

---

## 🧰 use it for:

- **design**, **diagnosis**, **teaching**, **analysis**
- any task that requires distinguishing between **subtle traits** or **complex internal structures**
