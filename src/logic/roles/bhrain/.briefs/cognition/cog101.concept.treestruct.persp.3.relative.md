# 🧭 .brief: concept.treestruct.relative

## .what
The **relative perspective** is a way of navigating the concept rootball from the standpoint of a **focal anchor** — a specific concept that frames all motion.

From this position, traversal is interpreted through **zoom metaphors** (`<zoomin>`, `<zoomout>`) and proceeds via either:
- **attributes** (internal features and structure)
- **neighbors** (external context and related concepts)

This model captures the experience of **thinking through** a concept — expanding, refining, abstracting, or reframing it locally.

---

## .why
This perspective allows:

- flexible conceptual movement without needing global coordinates
- support for local reasoning, reframing, and analogy
- expressive control over **zoom**, **detail**, and **contextual scope**
- modeling thought as **exploration**, not just location

---

## .mechanisms

Traversal in the relative perspective combines two dimensions:

### 🔀 mechanism of motion:
- `via(attributes)` → inward-facing — explores internal structure
- `via(neighbors)` → outward-facing — explores external associations

### 🎛 zoom direction:
- `<zoomin>` → dive deeper into a concept's composition
- `<zoomout>` → step back into its surrounding context

📌 These are metaphors: zoom direction is not absolute — it’s **anchored to the focal concept**.

## .example traversal: `"banana"`

Each semantic operation below is illustrative — not exhaustive:

### 🧠 abstraction

- `<zoomin><abstract>.via(attributes)`
  `"banana"` → `"fruit"` → `"plant organ"` → `"organic structure"`

- `<zoomout><abstract>.via(neighbors)`
  `"banana"` → `"apple"` ↔ `"mango"` → `"snack"` → `"food"` → `"thing"`

---

### 🎯 specification

- `<zoomin><specify>.via(attributes)`
  `"banana"` → `"ripe banana"` → `"peeled banana"` → `"sliced banana"`

- `<zoomout><specify>.via(neighbors)`
  `"banana"` → `"banana phone"` ↔ `"banana peel"` ↔ `"banana stand"`

---

### 🌐 broadening

- `<zoomin><broaden>.via(attributes)`
  `"banana"` → `"contains potassium"` ↔ `"is soft"` ↔ `"is curved"`

- `<zoomout><broaden>.via(neighbors)`
  `"banana"` → `"pineapple"` ↔ `"pear"` ↔ `"papaya"` ↔ `"guava"`

---

## .relativity of zoom direction

> **Zoom direction is always relative to the focal anchor.**

Examples:
- `"molecule"` is **outward** from `"atom"`, but **inward** from `"protein"`
- `"snack"` is **outward** from `"banana"`, but **inward** from `"lunch"`

There is no contradiction — only a **change in frame**.
What defines direction is **semantic proximity to the chosen center**, not absolute position.

---

## .relation to universal structure

- the relative perspective **operates within** the universal rootball
- but it interprets motion through **subjective zoom**, not spherical coordinates
- zoom-based motion may be radial, lateral, or angular in universal terms — but those distinctions are not necessary locally

> All relative paths, no matter how they begin, will eventually **converge inward** toward the universal root: `"concept"`.

---

## .notes

- relative perspective is ideal for:
  - everyday thinking
  - analogical reasoning
  - exploration of unfamiliar domains
- the focal anchor acts like a **semantic lens** — shaping how the local region of the rootball is viewed and explored

> Thinking is not positionless.
> It always starts **somewhere**.
