# üå∏ .brief: `cauliflorous.plants`

## .what
**Cauliflorous plants** are species that produce **flowers and fruits directly from their main stem, trunk, or older branches**, rather than at the tips of new growth.

> This unusual trait is known as **cauliflory** and is most commonly found in tropical species.

---

## üåê ecological function

Cauliflory supports unique plant-animal interactions by:

- **Enabling access** to flowers and fruits for **ground-dwelling pollinators and dispersers**
  (e.g., rodents, bats, flightless birds)
- **Reducing vertical competition** by flowering and fruiting below the canopy
- **Improving pollination success** in shaded or dense environments

## üå± notable examples

| plant                     | use / region                      |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| *Theobroma cacao*         | cacao (chocolate), South America |
| *Artocarpus heterophyllus* | jackfruit, Southeast Asia         |
| *Durio spp.*              | durian, Southeast Asia           |
| *Plinia cauliflora*       | jaboticaba, Brazil               |

---

## üß¨ botanical mechanism

- Flowers develop from **dormant buds** embedded in older, woody tissue.
- Often associated with **woody perennials** in **humid tropics**.

---

## .why it matters

Cauliflory illustrates how plant morphology can evolve to match **ecological niches** ‚Äî
especially where typical pollinators or dispersers are **not airborne**.

It also inspires biomimetic designs for **low-access harvesting**, **layered ecosystems**, and **ground-level productivity**.
