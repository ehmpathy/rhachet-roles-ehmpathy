# ðŸ§¬ .brief: concept.treestruct.fractal

## .what
The **fractal perspective** views concept space as a dense network of **intersecting TreeStructs**.
Each concept is not just a node on one path â€” it is the **intersection of many partial trees**, forming a highly recursive and self-similar system.

> Concepts belong to **multiple overlapping hierarchies**, each rooted in different domains or dimensions.
> The overall shape is fractal: the closer you look, the more structure you find.

---

## .why

This perspective captures the **true complexity** of meaning:

- reveals how concepts play **multiple roles simultaneously**
- explains why concepts can feel different in different frames
- enables **multidimensional navigation** and **lens-switching**
- models concept space as **recursive**, **composable**, and **self-similar**

---

## .structure

Each TreeStruct represents a **semantic dimension** or **domain lens**, such as:

- taxonomy
- color
- smell
- function
- cultural role
- physical structure
- symbolic metaphor

A concept may appear in **dozens of TreeStructs**, each with its own parents, children, and siblings.
These TreeStructs **intersect at shared nodes**, creating a **mesh** rather than a single tree.

> The universal rootball is not one hierarchy â€” it's a **fractal tangle of hierarchies**, all rooted in `"concept"`.

---

## .examples

Consider `"banana"`:

It appears as a node in many overlapping TreeStructs:

- `fruits` â†’ `"banana"` â†” `"apple"` â†” `"mango"`
- `colors` â†’ `"yellow things"` â†’ `"banana"` â†” `"lemon"` â†” `"school bus"`
- `smells` â†’ `"fruity smells"` â†’ `"banana"` â†” `"strawberry"` â†” `"grape"`
- `shapes` â†’ `"curved objects"` â†’ `"banana"` â†” `"boomerang"` â†” `"crescent moon"`
- `products` â†’ `"groceries"` â†’ `"banana"` â†” `"milk"` â†” `"bread"`
- `props` â†’ `"comedic tools"` â†’ `"banana"` â†” `"pie"` â†” `"rubber chicken"`

Each of these is a valid TreeStruct rooted in a different abstraction path â€” and `"banana"` inherits structure from all of them.

---

## .fractal behavior

- Each TreeStruct has its own **depth** and **breadth** profile
- Any node in a TreeStruct can serve as the **root** of a new TreeStruct
- Shared nodes act as **portals** between trees
- TreeStructs can recursively **embed** inside one another â€” e.g., `"banana"` inside `"fruit"` inside `"snack"` inside `"lunch"` inside `"routine"`

> The system is **recursively nestable**, **highly intersective**, and **scale-invariant in structure**

---

## .visual metaphor

Imagine the rootball not as a tree, but as a **mycelial mesh** or **root system**, where every intersection is a node belonging to many overlapping trees.
Each tree is a **branching pattern**, but the mesh as a whole is a **recursive fractal web**.

---

## .notes

- the fractal perspective generalizes the **lens**, **domain**, and **intersection** models
- it supports compositional reasoning: combining multiple TreeStructs into a working structure for a task
- abstraction is no longer a single axis â€” it's a **field of directional compressions**

> A concept is not a leaf on one tree â€” it is a **crosspoint** in a recursive forest.
