# ❓ .brief: `interrogative.primitives`

## .what

**interrogative primitives** are the **universal, semantic building blocks**
that underlie all question forms across human languages.

They serve as the **deep structure** of inquiry —
basic cognitive intents like *"what is it?"*, *"who did it?"*, or *"I want to know"*,
which are **expressed in different surface forms** depending on the language or system.

In structured reasoning systems (like `cortal.focus`), interrogative primitives
are also used as **motion triggers** — initiating semantic traversal
across specific focus axes (e.g. breadth, depth, acuity).

## 🌐 linguistic foundation

This concept draws from **Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM)** theory,
which identifies **semantic primes** — universal concepts
that exist in all languages and are irreducible.

| theory term        | role in questioning                                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **semantic prime** | the irreducible core meaning (e.g. *"something?"*)        |
| **interrogative primitive** | universal questioning intent (e.g. *"I want to know X"*) |
| **deep structure** | the underlying conceptual frame of the question           |
| **surface structure** | the language-specific form used to express it           |

> ✨ Despite variation in syntax, **all languages ask the same kinds of questions**
> — using different tools to express the same deep conceptual needs.

## 🔄 interrogatives as motion triggers

In the `cortal.focus` system, each interrogative primitive
can be interpreted as a **semantic motion vector** —
a directive to shift focus along a particular axis of thought.

> e.g.
> “why?” → generalize causally
> “how?” → decompose structurally
> “what?” → articulate traits or instantiate

---

## 🧬 precision and composition

Primitive questions are often **rough** — initiating motion but underspecified.
They can be **refined** or **composed** into **smoother** asks
that encode more direction and scope.

| progression example |
|---------------------|
| “why?” → “why did it happen?” → “what underlying mechanism caused it to shift at time X?” |

> 📈 Smoother questions = tighter alignment to the answer space

## 🌍 language diversity, semantic unity

| language    | "what"   | "who"     | "where"   |
|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| English     | what     | who       | where     |
| Spanish     | ¿qué?    | ¿quién?   | ¿dónde?   |
| Japanese    | なに (nani) | だれ (dare) | どこ (doko) |

> 🌐 Despite grammatical variation, **the same interrogative primitives persist**
> — reflecting the **shared conceptual skeleton** of human inquiry.

## 🪞 metaphor

> interrogative primitives are like **universal levers**:
> every human uses them to reach, reveal, and resolve meaning —
> no matter the language, system, or medium.

## 🎯 use when you want to:

- model the **core cognitive forms** behind all questions
- trace how questions **initiate motion** in structured thought systems
- scaffold natural language queries into semantic motion vectors
- teach or design interfaces for **language-agnostic inquiry**
