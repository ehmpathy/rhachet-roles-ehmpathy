# 🌲 .brief: concept.treestruct

## .what
The **concept.treestruct** is a semantic structure where concepts are arranged as interconnected nodes within a **radial RootStruct**, centered on the abstract core: `"concept"`.

Rather than a single hierarchy, the TreeStruct is a **recursive mesh** of intersecting conceptual trees.
It enables navigation through **abstraction**, **specialization**, **clustering**, and **frame-shifting**, supporting both **structured reasoning** and **creative exploration**.

---

## .why
This structure enables rich, flexible reasoning:

- models concept space as a **geometry of meaning**
- supports **semantic traversal** along depth, breadth, and perspective
- reflects how humans think: by **anchoring**, **zooming**, **shifting**, and **linking**
- integrates both **objective structure** and **subjective experience**

---

## .directions
Traversal within the TreeStruct occurs in distinct directions:

- **radial** → abstraction or specialization
  - inward = more abstract (e.g. `"banana"` → `"fruit"` → `"plant organ"`)
  - outward = more specific (e.g. `"fruit"` → `"banana"` → `"ripe banana"`)

- **lateral** → peer clustering
  - shift across neighboring nodes at the same depth
  - e.g. `"banana"` ↔ `"mango"` ↔ `"apple"`

- **angular** → frame-shifting
  - shift semantic axis or domain (e.g. taxonomy → function → metaphor)
  - often includes radial movement as well
  - e.g. `"knife"` ↔ `"word"` (metaphor: both cut)

> Lateral ≈ angular when angular displacement is small.
> Angular motion becomes distinct when reframing occurs across axes or domains.

---

## .geometry
The TreeStruct forms an **infinite radial space**, anchored at `"concept"`. Its topology supports:

- `focal.depth` → radial distance from the core (abstraction level)
- `focal.breadth` → number of peer or radial options in view
- `focal.acuity` → level of resolution within the current concept

Traversal is:
- **continuous** (drifting among neighbors)
- **recursive** (zooming into sub-structures)
- **semantic** (paths shaped by meaning, not just structure)

> Thought is not linear — it spirals through this field of meaning.

---

## .metaphor
Think of the concept.treestruct as a **semantic gravity field**:

- zoom **inward** to distill essence
- zoom **outward** to expand contextual roles
- pan **laterally** to compare siblings
- bend **angularly** to reframe or analogize

> High-gravity concepts shape your local space of thought.
> You orbit them — or escape them — with effort.

---

## .example

Starting at the concept **“banana”**:

- **radial-in**: `"banana"` → `"fruit"` → `"plant organ"` → `"organic structure"`
- **radial-out**: `"banana"` → `"ripe banana"` → `"peeled banana"`
- **lateral**: `"banana"` ↔ `"mango"` ↔ `"pineapple"`
- **angular**:
  - `"banana"` ↔ `"banana phone"` (visual pun)
  - `"banana"` ↔ `"joke"` (slapstick tool)
  - `"banana"` ↔ `"color yellow"` (perceptual role)

---

## .struct
The TreeStruct is:

- **recursive** — any node can be a root of a new TreeStruct
- **intersective** — nodes may appear in multiple trees simultaneously
- **perspectival** — motion can be described from:
  - the **universal perspective** (objective coordinates)
  - the **relative perspective** (anchored focal view)
  - the **fractal perspective** (nested, overlapping trees)

> Meaning is not contained in a single path — it emerges from intersections.

---

## .notes
This model integrates with:

- **cortal.focus mechanics**
  - `focal.depth`, `focal.breadth`, and `focal.acuity`
- **concept.gravity**
  - high-gravity nodes anchor navigation and recall
- **concept.traversal**
  - radial, lateral, and angular motion as the grammar of thought
- **concept.lens** *(implied)*
  - perspectives and domain lenses guide how the structure is explored

> The TreeStruct is not just a model of concepts —
> it’s a model of how thought moves through them.
