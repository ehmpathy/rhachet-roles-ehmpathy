# üñºÔ∏è [gallery]: `<ponder>` example ‚Äî fixing a broken lawnmower

## üõ† scenario
A small engine repair shop wants to create a **diagnostic plan** for a customer‚Äôs broken lawnmower that won‚Äôt start.
They use `<ponder>` to structure the reasoning before writing the plan.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è prompt input

\`\`\`ts
ponder: {
  contextualize: [
    {
      what: { question: "What do we know about the mower's condition?", priority: "MUST" },
      why: { rationale: "We need a clear baseline before diagnosis." }
    },
    {
      what: { question: "What has the customer already tried?", priority: "MUST" },
      why: { rationale: "Avoids repeating failed steps and wasted effort." }
    }
  ],
  conceptualize: [
    {
      what: { question: "What systems could be causing the failure?", priority: "MUST" },
      why: { rationale: "Defines the conceptual scope for troubleshooting." }
    },
    {
      what: { question: "What‚Äôs the fastest safe order to check them?", priority: "SHOULD" },
      why: { rationale: "Optimizes repair workflow for time and safety." }
    }
  ]

### ‚úÖ prompt output

\`\`\`ts
ponder: {
  contextualize: {
    "What do we know about the mower's condition?": "Engine turns over but won‚Äôt ignite, gas tank is half full, strong smell of gasoline.",
    "What has the customer already tried?": "Checked spark plug for dirt, replaced fuel with fresh gasoline."
  },
  conceptualize: {
    "What systems could be causing the failure?": "Ignition system, fuel delivery system, air intake system.",
    "What‚Äôs the fastest safe order to check them?": "1. Ignition (spark test), 2. Air filter, 3. Carburetor fuel flow."
  }
},
produce: {
  plan: [
    "Test spark plug with inline tester; replace if faulty.",
    "Inspect and clean air filter.",
    "Check carburetor fuel flow; clean jets if blocked."
  ]
}

### üí° why this works
- **contextualize** ensures the shop starts with known facts and avoids redundant steps.
- **conceptualize** frames the troubleshooting model and sequence before doing the work.
- **produce** emerges from the structured reasoning in `ponder`, making the plan traceable and auditable.
