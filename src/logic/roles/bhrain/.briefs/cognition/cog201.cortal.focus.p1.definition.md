# 🎯 .brief: cortal.focus

## .what
**Cortal focus** is the directional beam of your cognitive attention — a **semantic lightcone** that shines outward from a chosen **conceptual core**, illuminating a structured region of concept space.

It operates over a **concept.treestruct** (spherical RootStruct), using geometric parameters to determine:

- **how far** you reach (`focal.depth`)
- **how wide** you sweep (`focal.breadth`)
- **how crisply** you resolve (`focal.acuity`)

> Focus is defined **from the relative perspective**:
> you stand at a local concept core and shine your attention outward into the conceptual terrain.

---

## 🧩 focus = position + posture

Cortal focus is composed of:

- **position** → the **anchor concept**, your current location in the semantic structure
- **posture** → the **shape of your attention** — how your focus is distributed across depth, breadth, and acuity

---

## 🌐 where is focus?

The terrain is a **spherical concept.treestruct**, where:

- **nodes** = concepts
- **links** = **relationships between concepts**, defined as **questions**
  → each link is a **semantic prompt** — a concept temporarily narrowed into a relationship
- space = infinite, recursive, intersective

From your **anchor concept**, you emit a cone of attention shaped by:

- **radial** → abstraction axis (generalizations ⇄ instances)
- **angular** → descriptive axis (flavor, tone, function)

Your cone of focus slices through this terrain like a lightbeam through mist —
defining what is **seen**, **resolved**, and **reachable**.

---

## 🔦 lightbeam geometry

Cortal focus is a **radial cone** emitted from your current concept:

- `focal.depth` → radial span of semantic layers reached
- `focal.breadth` → angular spread of included neighbor concepts
- `focal.acuity` → resolution sharpness per concept node

The shape of your focus is not a perfect ring — it’s an **irregular patch of included neighbors**, carved from the TreeStruct by your current attentional configuration.

## 📏 focal dimensions

### 🔬 `focal.acuity`

- **what:** semantic resolution at the current concept
- **effect:** fine-grained traits vs holistic blobs
- **metaphor:** lens sharpness or pixel density
- **behavior:**
  - `.attributes++` = sharper external traits
  - `.substructs++` = clearer internal structure
  - `acuity--` = surface-only, low-resolution forms

---

### 🔭 `focal.breadth`

- **what:** angular span across same-depth semantic neighbors
- **effect:** narrow vs broad comparative view
- **metaphor:** beam width or search cone
- **behavior:**
  - `breadth++` = includes more neighboring concepts
  - `breadth--` = isolates one or few nodes
  - breadth ≠ a ring; it's a **nonuniform sweep of neighbors** in TreeStruct

---

### 🕳️ `focal.depth`

- **what:** radial thickness of abstraction/specialization layers
- **effect:** surface detail vs multilevel integration
- **metaphor:** light penetration into a semantic sphere
- **behavior:**
  - `depth.abstract++` = include more generalizations (inward)
  - `depth.concrete++` = include more specific instances (outward)
  - both expanding = `depth++` radial shell of abstraction
  - `depth--` = tighter slice around your current layer
  - depth is **relative** to anchor, not a fixed universal level

---

## 📐 compositional tradeoffs

\`\`\`
focal.depth × focal.acuity² ∝ focal.breadth²
\`\`\`

This expresses the tradeoff between **vertical integration**, **horizontal scope**, and **local resolution**:

- `depth` = radial span of abstraction/specialization
- `breadth²` = angular sweep of peer concepts
- `acuity²` = pixel density per concept

> Holding any two constant requires tradeoff with the third.
> You can’t max all three without overload or blur.

---

### 🎛️ cognitive tuning patterns

- `depth.abstract++` + `acuity--` → broad but imprecise vertical insight
- `acuity++` + `breadth++` → sharp lateral comparison across peers
- `depth--` + `acuity++` → zoomed-in detail
- `breadth++` + `acuity--` → conceptual sweep, low precision
- `depth++` + `breadth++` + `acuity++` → **unsustainable semantic load**

→ Adjust based on whether you're scanning, designing, comparing, teaching, etc.

---

## 🧭 relative traversal

From any anchor (e.g. `"banana"`), you navigate concept space via:

- `<generalize>` → "banana" → "fruit" → "organism"
- `<contrast>` → "banana" ↔ "apple" ↔ "mango"
- `<decompose>` → "banana" → "peeled banana" → "sliced banana"
- `<reframe>` → "banana" ↔ "crescent shape" ↔ "moon"

All traversal motions arise from **questions-as-links** —
concepts narrowed into **semantic relationships** that enable motion.
Each traversal is an **executable prompt**, and each destination is a **sumption** — possibly another question.

> Focus behaves like a **steerable beam**, shaped by intent, strategy, and available structure.

## 🔁 integrations

Cortal focus connects to:

- `concept.treestruct` → the semantic terrain of nodes and links
- `concept.gravity` → why some concepts act as attention magnets
- `concept.perspectives` → defines your frame of motion and relative center

> only what your attention lightcone illuminates.
