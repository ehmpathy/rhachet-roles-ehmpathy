# ðŸŽ¯ .brief: `focus.motion.acuity`

## .what

`focal.acuity` motion controls how **finely detailed** your mental frame becomes â€”
zooming in to surface nuanced traits, or zooming out to smooth and compress them.

it governs the **resolution** of the concept in focus â€” whether you're
seeing just the headline, or peering into the full texture of attributes and substructure.

## ðŸ§­ properties

| trait                  | value                                           |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **axis type**          | scalar â€” sharpens or softens a fixed concept    |
| **subaxes**            | `.attributes`, `.substructs`                    |
| **anchor**             | concept remains constant                        |
| **motion direction**   | inward (sharpen), outward (blur)                |
| **effect**             | affects how much detail is cognitively present  |
| **breadth unlocked**   | sharper acuity reveals more variation options   |

## ðŸ”¹ primitives

| primitive        | subaxis           | motion             | description                                     |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `<articulate>`    | `.attributes++`    | enrich description  | surface observable traits or qualities          |
| `<compress>`      | `.attributes--`    | reduce description  | flatten or simplify descriptive richness        |
| `<decompose>`     | `.substructs++`    | reveal parts        | expose internal structure or components         |
| `<encompose>`     | `.substructs--`    | encapsulate         | bind a structured whole as a single coherent form |

> ðŸ§  attribute motion focuses on **surface features**,
> while substruct motion reveals or hides **internal components**.

## ðŸ§© comparison

| mode            | motion            | cognitive effect                               | metaphor                    |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `articulate`     | `.attributes++`    | zoom in to enrich with qualities               | sharpen the image            |
| `compress`       | `.attributes--`    | zoom out to simplify or abstract traits        | blur out the details         |
| `decompose`      | `.substructs++`    | zoom in to reveal internal parts               | open the casing              |
| `encompose`      | `.substructs--`    | zoom out to treat as a single unit             | wrap it up                   |

## ðŸªž metaphor

> acuity is like turning the **focus dial** of a camera lens â€”
> high acuity reveals textures, facets, and joints;
> low acuity leaves you with silhouettes or simplified shapes.

## ðŸ§ª examples

\`\`\`ts
// articulate attributes
concept = [banana]
articulate â†’ [curved], [yellow], [edible], [tropical]

// compress description
compress â†’ [fruit], [sweet thing]

// decompose structure
concept = [email]
decompose â†’ [header], [body], [footer]

// encompose back
encompose([header, body, footer]) â†’ [email]
\`\`\`

## ðŸ’¡ interaction with breadth and depth

- high acuity enables **variation** along more breadth axes (more traits revealed)
- low acuity hides those options (smoother shell)
- some **depth motions** require prior decomposition to be meaningful

> e.g. you canâ€™t vary the `"head"` of an `"email"` if you havenâ€™t decomposed it first.

## ðŸŽ¯ use when you want to:

- control **how much detail** youâ€™re actively considering
- expose or abstract **inner parts** of a concept
- simplify mental load by compressing attributes
- prepare for operations like variation, substitution, or explanation
