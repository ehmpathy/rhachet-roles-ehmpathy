# 🔬 .brief: cortal.focal.acuity

## .what
**cortal.focal.acuity** governs the **semantic resolution** of each concept in focus — how **granular**, **fine-differentiated**, and **multi-dimensional** the concept representation is.

It determines how **much inner detail** your focus resolves per concept node within the radial `concept.treestruct`.

---

## 🧠 how it works

Acuity controls the **grain of resolution** across semantic traits:

- `acuity++` → high resolution
  - many dimensions: features, subtypes, conditions, histories
  - e.g. for [concept:"hammer"]: `head.mass`, `handle.material`, `strike.radius`

- `acuity--` → low resolution
  - coarse, holistic representations
  - e.g. just “thing you hit with”

It operates **independently** of:
- `focal.depth`: how many concept layers are stacked
- `focal.breadth`: how many neighbors are viewed

---

## 🔦 metaphor: optical focus

- high acuity = **sharp lens**
  - captures fine semantic edges and attributes
  - like increasing megapixels on a single node

- low acuity = **blurry filter**
  - sees only general shape or role
  - useful for fast scanning or abstract reasoning

---

## 📐 composition tradeoff

```
focal.depth × focal.acuity² ∝ focal.breadth²
```

Because acuity is squared, it's **computationally expensive** — high acuity costs high breadth or very limited depth without overload.

## 🧪 examples

### 🐶 [concept:"dog"]

- `acuity--`: “a furry animal that barks”
- `acuity++`:
  - `breed.type`, `coat.pattern`, `jaw.structure`, `training.history`, `social.role`

---

### 🔋 [concept:"battery"]

- `acuity--`: “thing that stores energy”
- `acuity++`:
  - `electrode.material`, `charge.curve`, `form.factor`, `voltage.stability`, `temp.range`

---

### 🪚 [concept:"handsaw"]

- `acuity--`: “tool for cutting”
- `acuity++`:
  - `tooth.pitch`, `blade.flex`, `grip.material`, `cut.style`, `pull.push.orientation`

---

## 🎯 why acuity matters

High acuity enables:

- **precise design thinking**
- **deep diagnosis**
- **feature-based comparison**

Low acuity supports:

- **rapid categorization**
- **abstraction and generalization**
- **semantic compression**

---

## 🔁 dynamic behavior

Acuity is often **modulated** as you move between tasks:

- zoom in = `acuity++` to analyze fine traits
- zoom out = `acuity--` to generalize or jump layers

Acuity can also vary **per neighbor** during lateral traversal — some concepts may be crisp, others fuzzy.

---

## 🧰 use it for:

- **design**, **diagnosis**, **teaching**, **modeling**
- any task that benefits from distinguishing between **subtle features** or **internal structure**
