# 🧰 .brief: `cortal.focus.usecases`

## .what

This brief catalogs **usecases for thinking explicitly about focus**
— when it's helpful to become aware of `focus.context`, `focus.concept`, and their configuration.

These are moments where **meta-focus** enables stronger reasoning, clarity, or problem-solving.

> To use focus well is to **see clearly**, **ask precisely**, and **move intentionally** through complex ideas.

## 🧠 why think about focus?

Most reasoning happens *with* focus but not *about* it.

> But in moments of friction, ambiguity, or overload —
> explicitly managing your focus can transform how you think.

Thinking about focus helps you:

- **reset direction** (when stuck or scattered)
- **reframe problems** (by rotating context or anchor)
- **improve question quality** (via sharper configuration)
- **accelerate insight** (by tuning depth, breadth, acuity)

## 📘 key usecases

| usecase                  | what you do                                       | why it matters                                                |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **🧠 gather your focus**      | align context and concept intentionally          | prepares you to ask precise, meaningful questions               |
| **🪞 reflect on your focus**  | notice what you're holding + how                 | builds meta-cognition; reveals hidden assumptions or noise      |
| **🧵 trace a focus drift**    | identify where your attention slipped            | helps recover lost clarity or intent                            |
| **📐 compress your focus**   | distill many ideas into one articulable node     | boosts communicability and insight                              |
| **🎯 aim your focus**        | pick a better anchor concept                     | sharpens the entry point of exploration                         |
| **🔀 reframe your focus**    | shift interpretive context                       | enables new understandings or alternate paths                   |
| **🚪 unblock with focus**    | realize a question is stuck due to bad focus     | unlocks better questions and next moves                         |
| **🌀 overload triage**       | manage breadth/depth/acuity tradeoffs            | prevents overwhelm or blur                                      |

## 🧠 example: compress your focus

You’ve just gathered a wide set of notes across multiple concepts.
They feel loosely related, but disorganized.

By **articulating** the shared traits and **generalizing** an abstraction,
you compress the mess into a **new focal concept**.

```txt
"These are all ways people avoid decisions"
→ articulate
→ [concept: decision avoidance]
```


> Compression is how focus becomes **portable**, **nameable**, and **sharable**.

## 🔁 when to think about focus

- when you're **lost** → “what am I even trying to do?”
- when you're **stuck** → “why can’t I ask a better question?”
- when you're **drowning** → “too much info, no handle”
- when you're **scattered** → “my thoughts are all over the place”
- when you're **teaching** → “what should the learner focus on?”
- when you're **designing prompts** → “how should this be framed?”
