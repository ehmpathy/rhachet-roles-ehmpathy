# üñº .gallery: blue-collar examples of `[brief]`

## .what
This gallery **<illustrate>** how `[brief]` can be applied in **blue-collar contexts**,
capturing knowledge, procedures, and best practices for practical trades.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ `[article]` ‚Äî berries (core concepts)
**Purpose:** Define a single trade concept in full.
**Example:** `.brief: concrete.mixing`

    \`\`\`md
    # üèó .brief: concrete.mixing

    ## .what
    Concrete mixing is the process of combining cement, aggregate, and water
    to create a workable material that hardens into a stone-like mass.

    ---

    ## üìê standard mix ratio (by volume)
    - 1 part cement
    - 2 parts sand
    - 3 parts gravel
    - water until workable consistency is achieved

    ---

    ## ‚ö†Ô∏è safety notes
    - Wear gloves, dust mask, and eye protection
    - Avoid skin contact with wet cement ‚Äî it is caustic

## ü™û self-reference
These examples show `[brief]` as an **elemental primitive** in action for trades:
- `[article]` defines a core task or material
- `[catalog]` organizes related concepts
- `[gallery]` documents examples and observations
Together, they form a **self-sustaining knowledge base** for practical work.
