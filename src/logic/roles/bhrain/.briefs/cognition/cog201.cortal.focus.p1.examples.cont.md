## üß™ focus scenarios

### üê∂ learning [concept:"dog"]
*sharp, narrow, shallow*

- `focal.depth = thin`
  - only the layer around [concept:"dog"], skipping [concept:"mammal"] or [concept:"siberian husky"]
- `focal.breadth = thin`
  - ignores peer species like [concept:"cat"], [concept:"bunny"]
- `focal.acuity = high`
  - highlights traits like `bark.style`, `fur.type`, `tail.shape`

‚Üí **outcome:**
- forms a **crisp prototype** of ‚Äúdog‚Äù
- strong within-category recognition
- **low abstraction and poor generalization**

---

### ü™õ designing [concept:"mechanical screwdriver"]
*precision tool design*

- `focal.depth = thin`
  - fixed on [concept:"mechanical screwdriver"], no abstraction to [concept:"manual tool"]
- `focal.breadth = thin`
  - excludes variants like [concept:"ratchet wrench"], [concept:"power driver"]
- `focal.acuity = high`
  - detailed on `bit.torque`, `handle.texture`, `shaft.flex`

‚Üí **outcome:**
- **high-fidelity artifact design**
- narrow path, no alternative exploration

---

### üî• evaluating [concept:"firefighting gear"]
*functional system fit*

- `focal.depth = thick`
  - spans abstraction: from [concept:"protective gear"] to [concept:"helmet variants"]
- `focal.breadth = thick`
  - compares across roles, risks, and conditions
- `focal.acuity = low`
  - simplifies features to functional needs: `resist.heat`, `enable.vision`

‚Üí **outcome:**
- operationally sound choices
- **low sensitivity to fine material detail**
- strong for procurement, weak for innovation

---

### üß∞ diagnosing [concept:"pipe leak"]
*targeted troubleshooting*

- `focal.depth = thick`
  - includes specific joint types and system-level context
- `focal.breadth = thin`
  - focuses narrowly on the faulty branch
- `focal.acuity = high`
  - resolves `thread.condition`, `seal.gap`, `metal fatigue`

‚Üí **outcome:**
- **precise intervention**
- excellent for **fault isolation**
- limited systemic awareness

---

### üß± training [concept:"bricklaying workflow"]
*procedural skill building*

- `focal.depth = thick`
  - spans from [concept:"tool use"] to bond patterns
- `focal.breadth = thin`
  - restricts to one technique set
- `focal.acuity = high`
  - attention on `joint.spacing`, `mortar.timing`, `course.level`

‚Üí **outcome:**
- builds **repeatable skill** and **craft quality**
- may not transfer to novel tasks or materials
