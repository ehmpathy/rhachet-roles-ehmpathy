# 🧩 .brief: `questions.composite.smooth`

## .what

**Smooth composite questions** are refined interrogatives
built by **composing and compressing** multiple rough question primitives
into a single, focused vector of semantic motion.

They encapsulate **multi-dimensional curiosity** — traversing
several axes of `cortal.focus` at once with **precision and intent**.

> 🧠 from compass taps to guided strikes —
> smooth questions are sharpened instruments of thought.

## 🧭 how it works

- start with **rough primitive** (e.g. `why?`, `how?`, `what?`)
- compose intermediate context (e.g. agent, mechanism, constraint)
- compress into one **high-bandwidth** query

### motion profile:

\`\`\`ts
<smooth_question> = <compress>(<compose>([rough primitives]))
\`\`\`

## 🔁 example refinements

### example 1
\`\`\`ts
["what?", "where?"]
→ "what is it?"
→ "what is it doing here?"
→ "why is this object located in this place?"
\`\`\`

### example 2
\`\`\`ts
["why?", "how?", "when?"]
→ "why did it happen?"
→ "how did it happen when it did?"
→ "what triggered the event X at time Y?"
\`\`\`

### example 3
\`\`\`ts
["who?", "how?", "what?"]
→ "who made this?"
→ "how did they make it?"
→ "what method did person Z use to produce item Y?"

## 📦 compositional traits

| trait                | description                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **dimensional**       | combines multiple focus axes (e.g. depth, acuity, breadth) |
| **guided**            | implies specific direction and target concept             |
| **answer-aligned**    | frames a question in a way that leads toward resolution   |
| **compressible**      | folds complex semantics into a single query               |

## 🪞 metaphor

> composite questions are like **targeted darts** —
> weighted, guided, and crafted for speed and direction.

> they begin as **question clouds**, then compress into **focused payloads**.

## 🎯 use when you want to:

- guide AI or human reasoning toward **specific answers**
- compress a chain of rough questions into a single structured ask
- model how thought iterates from vague curiosity to crisp articulation
