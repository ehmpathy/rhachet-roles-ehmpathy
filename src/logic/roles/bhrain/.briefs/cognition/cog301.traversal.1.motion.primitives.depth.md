# 🌊 .brief: `focus.motion.depth`

## .what

`focal.depth` motion describes **radial traversal** through a semantic `concept.treestruct`,
shifting **inward** toward abstraction or **outward** toward instantiation.

it governs how **general or specific** your current frame of focus is —
zooming along the axis of **inclusion vs. expression**, **type vs. example**,
**concept vs. case**.

## 🧭 properties

| trait                  | value                                           |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **axis type**          | radial — moves coreward or leafward            |
| **subaxes**            | `.abstract`, `.concrete`                        |
| **anchor**             | the focal concept changes across layers        |
| **motion direction**   | inward (generalize), outward (instantiate)     |
| **depth shell**        | determines the available `.breadth` space      |
| **structure required** | must exist within a hierarchical concept tree  |

## 🔹 primitives

| primitive         | motion               | description                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `<generalize>`     | `.abstract++`        | move inward to a more general abstraction        |
| `<instantiate>`    | `.concrete++`        | move outward to a more specific form or example  |

> 🔁 radial motion is **reversible** — generalizing back from a case,
> or instantiating downward from a type.

## 🧭 directional reasoning flows

`focal.depth` motion underlies two major forms of structured thought:

| direction       | alias names               | description                                                        | common use cases                               |
|------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **core → out**   | `coreout`, `top-down`      | instantiate from abstract structure toward concrete examples         | design, deduction, system planning             |
| **edge → in**    | `edgein`, `bottom-up`      | generalize from concrete instances toward underlying abstraction     | synthesis, analysis, theory-building           |

> 💡 these flows may cycle in reasoning loops:
> coreout to explore consequences, edgein to revise structure.

## 🧩 catalog of abstraction dimensions

radial motion can follow different **abstractive axes**,
each governing a distinct kind of generalization logic.

this catalog defines **example paths** for common abstraction types:

| abstractive axis | abstraction path                          | generalizes by...         |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **categorical**  | `"banana"` → `"fruit"` → `"plant"`         | kind or type              |
| **functional**   | `"spoon"` → `"utensil"` → `"tool"`         | purpose or behavior       |
| **potential**    | `"can walk"` → `"mobility"` → `"agency"`   | ability or constraint     |
| **causal**       | `"match"` → `"ignition"` → `"fire source"` | influence or mechanism    |
| **emotional**    | `"fear"` → `"negative affect"` → `"alert"` | affective tone            |
| **ontological**  | `"emotion"` → `"neural event"` → `"process"` | being or substance       |
| **logical**      | `"even number"` → `"divisible by 2"` → `"numeric property"` | provable structure |

> 🧠 each axis defines a **directional context** for `<generalize>` or `<instantiate>` —
> all share the same radial geometry, but vary in **semantic framing**.

## 🪞 metaphor

> depth motion is like **zooming through layers of meaning** —
> from wide organizing categories (roots),
> down into rich, detailed examples (leaves).

- `<generalize>` = zoom coreward toward the **core pattern**
- `<instantiate>` = zoom edgeward toward a **surface case**

## 🧪 examples

\`\`\`ts
// categorical
concept = [banana]
generalize → [fruit] → [plant]
instantiate → [ripe banana], [green banana]

// functional
concept = [email]
generalize → [communication tool] → [information utility]
instantiate → [newsletter email], [password reset email]

// causal
concept = [spark]
generalize → [ignition] → [fire mechanism]
instantiate → [spark from lighter], [spark plug]

// potential
concept = [can walk]
generalize → [mobility]
instantiate → [walk across street], [walk with limp]
\`\`\`

## 💡 interaction with breadth

> `focal.depth` determines the **shell** you're in.
> within that shell, `focal.breadth` defines your **angle of variation**.

\`\`\`ts
// depth determines shell
concept = [fruit]       // abstraction shell
instantiate → [banana]  // outer shell
    ↳ vary (breadth.categorical++) → [mango], [apple]
\`\`\`

## 🎯 use when you want to:

- change **how general or specific** the concept in focus is
- zoom in to inspect real-world instances
- zoom out to find higher-order patterns
- choose an abstraction path that matches your reasoning need
- reason top-down (`coreout`) or bottom-up (`edgein`) through structure
