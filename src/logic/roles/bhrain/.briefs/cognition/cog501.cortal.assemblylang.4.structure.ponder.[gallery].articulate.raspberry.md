# üçì Example: `<ponder>` in action ‚Äî defining a *raspberry*

We will illustrate how `<ponder>` can be used to **define a concept from scratch**
by refining our semantic direction through structured questioning.

---

## üéØ goal

> articulate a semantic brief of `[concept:"raspberry"]`
> (i.e., define what a raspberry *is* in structured terms)

---

## üß† ponder scaffold

We‚Äôll structure the thinking via:

\`\`\`ts
<ponder>.with({
  contextualize: [...],
  conceptualize: [...]
})
\`\`\`

---

## üß© contextualize ‚Äî posture setup

These questions populate `focus.context`,
clarifying what‚Äôs known, what‚Äôs assumed, and what matters.

\`\`\`ts
contextualize: [
  {
    what: { question: "What kind of thing am I trying to define?", priority: "MUST" },
    why: { rationale: "Establishes category-level expectations" }
  },
  {
    what: { question: "What do I already associate with raspberries?", priority: "SHOULD" },
    why: { rationale: "Surfaces existing knowledge or bias" }
  },
  {
    what: { question: "What properties seem relevant here ‚Äî taste, shape, origin?", priority: "SHOULD" },
    why: { rationale: "Identifies descriptive axes to consider" }
  },
  {
    what: { question: "How is this different from other berries?", priority: "COULD" },
    why: { rationale: "Prepares contrastive context for later clarification" }
  }
]
\`\`\`

---

## üß≠ resulting context

After answering the above, we might hold:

- category = fruit ‚Üí berry? aggregate fruit?
- associations = small, red, sweet-tart, seedy
- axes = color, size, texture, growth pattern, seed structure
- relevant comparisons = strawberry, blackberry, cherry

---

## üß© conceptualize ‚Äî position shift

These questions refine or reset the `focus.concept`,
guiding toward more precise semantic anchors for articulation.

\`\`\`ts
conceptualize: [
  {
    what: { question: "What structure explains what a raspberry is?", priority: "MUST" },
    why: { rationale: "Surfaces defining internal composition" }
  },
  {
    what: { question: "What class of thing does a raspberry belong to?", priority: "MUST" },
    why: { rationale: "Ensures correct abstraction layer is targeted" }
  },
  {
    what: { question: "What makes a raspberry different from other similar fruits?", priority: "SHOULD" },
    why: { rationale: "Enables contrastive articulation" }
  },
  {
    what: { question: "What is essential and what is incidental to being a raspberry?", priority: "SHOULD" },
    why: { rationale: "Helps prioritize core properties in the definition" }
  }
]
\`\`\`

---

## üß† example answers

These may emerge during the ponder:

- a raspberry is an **aggregate fruit** made of many small drupelets
- it belongs to the **genus Rubus** in the rose family
- it‚Äôs **distinct from a strawberry**, which is not an aggregate of drupelets
- it is **not a botanical berry**, despite the name
- essential traits: red/purple drupelets, hollow core, tart flavor
- incidental traits: seasonal availability, common in desserts

## üßæ resulting semantic brief

\`\`\`md
# üçì .brief: raspberry

A **raspberry** is an **aggregate fruit** composed of many small, seed-bearing **drupelets**,
arranged around a hollow core. It belongs to the **Rubus genus** in the rose family (Rosaceae).
Despite the name, it is not a true botanical berry.

Typical raspberries are **red or purple**, **soft**, and **tart-sweet**,
commonly used in desserts, jams, and fresh consumption.

Its **defining features** include:
- multiple fused drupelets
- hollow center
- tart-sweet flavor
\`\`\`

## üß© recap: how `<ponder>` shaped the definition

- **contextualize** ‚Üí scoped the problem, surfaced salient properties
- **conceptualize** ‚Üí selected the defining structure, clarified boundaries
- the composed **question route** mutated focus.context + focus.concept
- result = structured semantic direction ‚Üí clear, articulate brief
