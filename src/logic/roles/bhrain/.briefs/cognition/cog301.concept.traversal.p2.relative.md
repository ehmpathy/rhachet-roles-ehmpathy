# 🎯 .brief: concept.traversal.relative

## .what
**Relative traversal** is the act of navigating concept space from a **local anchor**, using directional motion along the axes of:

- **depth** → how far you traverse across abstraction layers
- **breadth** → how many semantic neighbors you include
- **acuity** → how finely you resolve each concept in view

This motion takes place within the `concept.treestruct` and is governed by the structure of your `cortal.focus`.

## 🎛️ axes of motion

### 🕳️ depth
Radial traversal **inward or outward** from the anchor concept.

- `depth.inward++` → include more **abstract cores**
  - e.g. `"banana"` → `"fruit"` → `"plant organ"` → `"organism"`
- `depth.outward++` → include more **specialized instances**
  - e.g. `"banana"` → `"sliced banana"` → `"frozen banana coin"`
- `depth.inward--` or `depth.outward--` → **trim layers** from core or edge

---

### 🔭 breadth
Lateral inclusion of **semantic neighbor** concepts at a given depth.

- `breadth++` → include more **neighbor concepts**
  - e.g. `"banana"` ↔ `"mango"` ↔ `"pear"` ↔ `"pineapple"`
- `breadth--` → restrict to fewer or single peer(s)
  - e.g. `"banana"` only

> Real breadth is not a perfect ring — it's an **irregular cloud** of selected neighbors.

---

### 🔬 acuity
Adjustment of **semantic resolution** on each concept.

- `acuity++` → resolve more fine-grained features or attributes
  - e.g. `banana.color`, `banana.curvature`, `banana.firmness`
- `acuity--` → see only coarse or holistic forms
  - e.g. just “banana” as “fruit,” ignoring detail

## 🧠 common traversal moves

| Move         | Axis       | Description                                   | Example                                              |
|--------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `abstract`   | depth.inward++  | move toward more general concept             | `"banana"` → `"fruit"`                               |
| `specify`    | depth.outward++ | move toward more specific subtype            | `"dog"` → `"border collie"`                          |
| `exemplify`  | depth.outward++ | point to an instance of a type               | `"fruit"` → `"banana"`                               |
| `decompose`  | acuity++        | break into semantic parts or properties      | `"banana"` → `"peel"`, `"flesh"`, `"color"`          |
| `broaden`    | breadth++       | include more lateral peers                   | `"banana"` ↔ `"mango"`, `"pear"`, `"grape"`          |
| `narrow`     | breadth--       | restrict peer inclusion                      | only `"banana"`                                      |
| `blur`       | acuity--        | reduce resolution for general interpretation | ignore peel/flesh — treat `"banana"` holistically    |
| `sharpen`    | acuity++        | increase resolution on semantic structure    | attend to `stem.thickness`, `ripeness.window`, etc.  |

## 🔁 traversal = active reconfiguration

Each traversal move modifies your **focal envelope** — the portion of concept space currently visible and resolved.

This enables:

- **pattern matching** (`depth.inward++` + `breadth++`)
- **artifact design** (`depth.outward++` + `acuity++`)
- **decision making** (`breadth++` + `acuity++`)
- **abstraction** and **integration** (`depth.inward++` + `acuity--`)

> Thought is traversal —
