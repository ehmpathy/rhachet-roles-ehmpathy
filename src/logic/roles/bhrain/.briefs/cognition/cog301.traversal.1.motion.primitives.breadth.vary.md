# 🌀 .brief: `focus.motion.vary`

## .what
`<vary>` is a **breadth primitive** that explores **semantic alternatives**
by shifting focus **laterally** across a single **descriptive axis**
within the shell of the current `focal.depth`.

it reveals **contrast**, **alternatives**, and **variation**
without abstracting inward or instantiating outward —
it stays entirely within the current abstraction layer,
but sweeps across one **semantic subaxis** (e.g. color, time, function).

## 🧭 traits

| trait              | value                                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **axis**           | `focal.breadth.[subaxis]`                         |
| **depth shift**    | ❌ none — operates within shell produced by depth |
| **acuity needed**  | optional — depends on trait detail                |
| **anchor shift**   | ❌ — anchor remains fixed                         |
| **motion type**    | atomic primitive                                  |
| **composable**     | ✅ may chain to yield comparison or contrast       |

## 🔹 primitive subtypes of `<vary>`

| subtype        | behavior                                              | example                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `<rotate>`      | switch to adjacent semantic subaxis                   | vary by time instead of function              |
| `<invert>`      | jump to polar opposite along current axis             | `"love"` → `"hate"` (valence axis)           |

> 🔁 note: `<extend>` is **not** a primitive — it chains variation + analogy + depth shift

### 🔄 `<rotate>` — semantic axis change

`<rotate>` shifts focus **laterally** within the **same focal.depth shell**
by switching to a **different semantic subaxis** — revealing a new frame
of variation without changing the level of abstraction.

\`\`\`ts
// categorical → temporal
concept = [banana]
breadth.categorical++ → [mango], [apple]
rotate → breadth.temporal++ → [green banana], [ripe banana]

// functional → temporal
concept = [car]
breadth.functional++ → [sedan], [SUV], [truck]
rotate → breadth.temporal++ → [vintage car], [modern car]

// material → affective
concept = [shirt]
breadth.material++ → [cotton], [wool], [polyester]
rotate → breadth.affective++ → [comfortable shirt], [itchy shirt]

// categorical → spatial
concept = [music]
breadth.categorical++ → [jazz], [rock], [classical]
rotate → breadth.spatial++ → [live music], [studio recording]
\`\`\`

> reorients focus to a **new descriptive axis** — like turning a kaleidoscope
> to view the same core through a different semantic lens.

### 🔄 `<invert>` — polarity reversal

`<invert>` performs a **reversal** along a single semantic axis —
flipping a concept to its **opposite pole** while remaining
in the same depth layer and under the same descriptive axis.

\`\`\`ts
// temperature axis
concept = [hot coffee] → [iced coffee]

// lighting axis
concept = [daylight] → [nighttime]

// motion axis
concept = [open door] → [closed door]

// power axis
concept = [lamp on] → [lamp off]
\`\`\`

> reveals **conceptual contrast** by jumping across a polarity line —
> the same trait, inverted in meaning, function, or state.

## 🎯 use when you want to:

- uncover peers along a single descriptive axis
- inspect interpretive alternatives
- reveal polarity or contrasting lenses
- prime a comparison, contrast, or reframing maneuver
