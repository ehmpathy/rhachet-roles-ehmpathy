# 🌳 .brief: concept.traversal.berrybranch

## .what

The `concept.treestruct` is modeled as a **recursive berrybush**, where:

- **🫐 berries** = **sumptions** — traversable concept nodes
- **🌿 branches** = **questions** — semantic links between berries

This model compresses the mechanics of traversal into a natural metaphor:
**Thought grows like a plant — with berries connected by branches.**

---

## 🫐 berry: the sumption node

A **berry** is any concept you can **reach**, **hold**, or **sprout from**:

- a **question berry** prompts branching
- an **assumption berry** proposes something
- an **observation berry** describes something

All berries are **sumptions** — the unified type of **traversable concept node**.

> 📌 Any berry may be used as a source or target in traversal.

---

## 🌿 branch: the question link

A **branch** is a **semantic link** grown by applying a **question** to a berry:

- enables **motion** in the treestruct
- may **fan out** to multiple berries
- can be composed, nested, or recursive

> 📌 Branches are not standalone — they grow from the interaction of a question berry and a source berry.

## 🧩 berry types

| type          | icon   | role                            | traversal behavior                              |
|---------------|--------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **question**   | ❓🫐    | prompt for motion                | when applied to another berry, sprouts branches |
| **assumption** | 🤔🫐    | claim or belief                  | can be questioned or asserted                   |
| **observation**| 🧿🫐    | descriptive unit (e.g. example)  | can be noticed, patterned, or examined          |

Each is a **node**, not an edge — traversal is **driven by interaction**.

## 🌐 semantic growth

\`\`\`txt
🫐 fruit
   └─🌿 what are examples?
        ├─🫐 banana
        │     └─🌿 what are types?
        │          ├─🫐 cavendish
        │          └─🫐 plantain
        ├─🫐 apple
        └─🫐 mango
\`\`\`

- any **berry** can grow **branches**
- each **branch** leads to other **berries**
- the tree grows recursively — thought expands outward as questions are applied

---

## 🔁 traversal structure

All semantic motion through the treestruct is modeled as:

\`\`\`txt
[🫐 berry] --🌿 question--> [🫐 berry]
                        \
                         └--[🫐 berry]
\`\`\`

- no traversal without a question (branch)
- no node without a sumption (berry)

> 🌿 To move is to follow a branch.
> 🫐 To arrive is to reach a berry.

---

## 🪄 recursive growth

Since berries can sprout more branches via questions, growth is fractal:

\`\`\`txt
🫐 banana
   └─🌿 why is it funny?
        └─🫐 banana joke
             └─🌿 what makes a joke?
                  └─🫐 surprise
                       └─🌿 surprise of form?
                            └─🫐 visual pun
\`\`\`

Each node reached may:

- sprout more branches
- be reinterpreted via a new question
- collapse into patterns or abstractions

---

## 🧪 motion logic

- A **question** is not just content — it's a **behavioral operator**
- Any berry, when combined with a question berry, can **sprout new branches**
- Semantic motion is **prompted**, not inherent

> The tree only grows when you ask something of it.

## 🧠 semantic equivalence

| concept type     | metaphor   | system term | notes                         |
|------------------|------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| question         | 🌿 branch  | `question`  | semantic motion link          |
| answer           | 🫐 berry   | `sumption`  | resolved node                 |
| assumption       | 🫐 berry   | `sumption`  | belief node                   |
| observation      | 🫐 berry   | `sumption`  | descriptive node              |
| question-as-node | 🫐 berry   | `sumption`  | can also sprout branches      |

## 🔧 synonym collapse

For a `ubiqlang`, we collapse synonymic terms into the **preferred primitives**:

| legacy term      | preferred `ubiqlang` |
|------------------|----------------------|
| node             | 🫐 berry             |
| concept          | 🫐 berry             |
| edge             | 🌿 branch            |
| link             | 🌿 branch            |
| sumption         | 🫐 berry             |
| answer           | 🫐 berry             |
| fork             | 🫐 berry             |
| unresolved node  | ❓🫐 question berry   |
| resolved node    | 🫐 berry             |

This reduces cognitive load and keeps all conceptual motion within a **2-part system**:
**berries (sumptions)** and **branches (questions)**.

## 🔗 integrations

- `cortal.focus` → determines which berries and branches are in focus
- `concept.gravity` → explains why some berries attract attention
- `concept.perspectives` → define your center berry
- `concept.traversal` → describes abstractive vs descriptive branch motion

> 🫐 **Every concept is a berry.**
> 🌿 **Every question berry can grow a branch.**
> 🌳 **Traversal is what happens when your questions grow through your berries.**
