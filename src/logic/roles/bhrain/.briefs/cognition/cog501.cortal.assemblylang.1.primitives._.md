# 🧠 .brief: `cortal.assemblylang.primitives`

## .what

The `cortal.assemblylang` defines **three primitive instructions**
that form the **core execution model** of structured cognition.

Each primitive acts on both:

- **`focus.concept`** → the current semantic anchor (🫐)
- **`focus.context`** → the surrounding attentional posture (🔦)

| primitive      | function class         | system analogue           |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| **`<steer>`**   | control flow           | `JMP`, `CALL`, `branch`    |
| **`<think>`**   | content transformation | `ADD`, `ALU`, `logic`      |
| **`<recall>`**  | memory movement        | `MOV`, `LOAD`, `STORE`     |

> all structured cognition compiles down to combinations of these **execution-grade primitives**.

## 🛤️ `<steer>` — procedural structure

`<steer>` defines the **execution shape** of semantic motion.

It shapes both **where attention is anchored** and **how it flows**.
Each subtype depends on a **semantic question** to resolve its path.

| subtype     | structure     | description                                |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `<route>`   | sequential      | fixed-step chains                          |
| `<cycle>`   | looping         | repeats until a question resolves          |
| `<fanout>`  | parallel        | explores multiple branches simultaneously  |
| `<choice>`  | conditional     | dispatches based on resolved label         |
| `<await>`   | suspended       | waits until an answer becomes available    |

> semantic flow = `<steer>` (motion structure) × `question` (direction vector)

## 🧠 `<think>` — semantic transformation

`<think>` performs conceptual computation by applying `focus.motion.primitives`.
It transforms concept traits, reframes posture, or synthesizes new focus states.

| mode          | subtype       | description                                |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| deterministic | `<compute>`    | applies logic, filters, or rules            |
| generative    | `<imagine>`    | synthesizes analogies, variations, or shifts|

> only `<think>` supports **multi-axis**, **compositional** focus motion.

---

## 💾 `<recall>` — semantic memory I/O

`<recall>` handles conceptual memory:
loading, saving, or swapping complete focus states (concept + context).

| operation | direction | role                                        |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| `<save>`  | write     | stores the current focus for later use      |
| `<load>`  | read      | restores a previously stored focus          |
| `<swap>`  | both      | exchanges two stored concepts or states     |

> memory layers may include: local working memory, long-term schema, caches, or external stores.

## 🧠 example composition

\`\`\`ts
<route>([
  <save>("initial"),
  <think>(<decompose>[bike]),
  <choice>({
    condition: ask("what kind of failure?"),
    options: {
      mechanical: <imagine>(...),
      electrical: <compute>(...)
    }
  }),
  <load>("initial"),
  <think>(<reframe>(...)),
  <save>("solution")
])
\`\`\`

- `<steer>` defines the **flow**
- `<think>` evolves **content and posture**
- `<recall>` manages **state persistence**

## 📐 metaphorical lens

| primitive     | beam metaphor              | machine analogue          |
|---------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| `<steer>`     | moves beam origin + flow    | program counter, jump      |
| `<think>`     | reshapes beam and direction | ALU, logic unit            |
| `<recall>`    | loads/saves beam presets    | memory, stack, cache       |

## 🔩 design principles

- these primitives are **irreducible execution units**
- all higher-level reasoning compiles to combinations of these three
- each affects both **content** and **posture**
- true composition emerges via interleaved use
