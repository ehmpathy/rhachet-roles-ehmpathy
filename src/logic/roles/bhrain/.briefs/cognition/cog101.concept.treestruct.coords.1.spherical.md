# üå≥ .brief: `concept.treestruct.spherical`

## .why
use this brief if you want to...

- **understand how abstraction works** in a concept `TreeStruct`, in terms of generality and specificity

- **navigate or manipulate concepts radially** ‚Äî moving inward toward abstractions or outward toward instances

- **distinguish between different kinds of abstraction**, such as categorical vs functional vs modal

- **identify the semantic axis** a concept belongs to (e.g., ‚Äúfruit‚Äù is a categorical abstraction)

- **structure your knowledge hierarchically** by tracing how concepts generalize along meaningful dimensions

- **design tools or prompts** that rely on structured abstraction (e.g., AI reasoning, taxonomy design, teaching models)


## .what
The `concept.treestruct` models conceptual space using a **spherical coordinate system**, where each concept has both:

- a **radial position** *(aka "abstractive position")*: how abstract or concrete it is
- an **angular position** *(aka "descriptive position")*: how it varies descriptively from its peers

This structure allows concepts to be organized by both **hierarchical abstraction** and **semantic variation**, enabling multidirectional traversal.

## üß≠ dimensions

| spherical axis     | treestruct role                | alias                    | description                                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **radius** `r`     | abstractive hierarchy          | **abstractive position** | inward = more abstract/core<br>outward = more concrete/detail |
| **inclination** `Œ∏`| categorical differentiation    | **descriptive position** | vertical angular shifts between categories or frames  |
| **azimuth** `œÜ`    | sibling/instance differentiation | **descriptive position** | horizontal angular shifts between analogs or variants |

> The angular dimensions (`Œ∏`, `œÜ`) are both descriptive: they define where the concept sits relative to peers at the same level of abstraction.

## ü™ú radial motion: abstraction

Radial motion moves through layers of **conceptual generality**:

- **inward**: toward more universal, abstract ideas
- **outward**: toward more specific, detailed instances

This defines the **core structure** of the tree ‚Äî from root abstractions to concrete applications.

---

## üîÄ angular motion: variation

Angular motion explores **alternative expressions** at the same abstractive level:

- **vertical tilt** (`Œ∏`) shifts across **types or categories**
- **horizontal rotation** (`œÜ`) shifts across **peer instances or analogies**

These motions describe **semantic diversity**, not hierarchy.

---

## üåê structural implications

- The treestruct forms **layers of abstraction** (radial) populated by **rings of descriptive diversity** (angular)
- Concepts can be:
  - **grouped** by angular proximity (descriptive similarity)
  - **traced** by radial lineage (abstractive derivation)

---

## üåÄ navigation

- to **generalize** ‚Üí move **inward** (more abstract)
- to **specialize** ‚Üí move **outward** (more concrete)
- to **reframe**, **contrast**, or **analogize** ‚Üí rotate **angularly**

This enables precise, multidimensional navigation of meaning.
