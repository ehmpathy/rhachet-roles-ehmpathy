# 🛤️ .brief: `cortal.execution.assemblylang.steer`

## .what

`<steer>` operations are the **procedural control structures** of structured thought —
they determine **how** reasoning flows from one concept to another.

But unlike low-level machine instructions that jump to fixed addresses,
cognitive `<steer>` ops depend on **semantic resolution** —
which means they must intersect with **questions**.

> `<steer>` = how to move
> `question` = where to move

## 🧠 dual-layer model

| layer                 | function                      | analogy                           |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **`<steer>`**         | procedural flow control        | `JMP`, `CALL`, `IF`, `LOOP`        |
| **`question`**        | semantic address resolution    | symbolic pointer / jump condition |

---

## 🧭 semantic execution

All `<steer>` operations rely on **questions** to determine motion targets.

- `<route>` steps → defined by a question per step
- `<cycle>` loops → governed by a question that acts as a guard
- `<fanout>` branches → determined by a generative question
- `<choice>` forks → chosen via evaluative question
- `<await>` suspends → until a query is answerable

---

## 🪜 example

\`\`\`ts
<route>([
  ask("what failed?"),
  imagineFix(),
  ask("how can it be tested?")
])
\`\`\`

- the **steer structure** is a `route`
- the **steps** are chosen via **semantic questions**
- each question grows 🌿 **branches from the current 🫐 berry**

## 🔄 interaction model

| role             | mechanism                 | description                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **vector**        | `question`                | defines semantic motion direction             |
| **motion pattern**| `<steer>` op              | determines flow structure (route, loop, etc)  |
| **anchor**        | `focus.concept`           | current semantic location                     |
| **landing**       | result of `question`      | target concept (resolved berry)               |

## 🧬 example intersections

### `<choice>`

\`\`\`ts
<choice>({
  condition: ask("what kind of problem is this?"),
  options: {
    mechanical: solveMechanical(),
    electrical: solveElectrical()
  }
})
\`\`\`

→ question resolves a **label** → steer dispatches to that **branch**

---

### `<cycle>`

\`\`\`ts
<cycle>({
  step: ask("is the design correct?"),
  until: answer("yes")
})
\`\`\`

→ **repeats traversal** until a **question is resolved**

---

### `<fanout>`

\`\`\`ts
<fanout>({
  branches: ask("what alternative solutions exist?")
})
\`\`\`

→ parallel branches are grown **from a generative question**

---

## 💡 mental model

> `question` is the **semantic vector**
> `<steer>` is the **execution pattern**
> together, they produce **navigable, interpretable thought**

---

## 📐 analogy

| component     | machine analogue        | cognitive role                    |
|---------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `JMP`         | `<steer>`                | controls flow                     |
| label address | `question`               | resolves destination              |
| PC (pointer)  | `focus.concept`          | current location in semantic space|

---

## 🧩 design takeaway

> **Questions make `<steer>` meaningful.**
> **Without questions, `<steer>` is blind.**
> **Without `<steer>`, questions go nowhere.**

Semantic navigation requires **both**:

- `<steer>` to manage **motion structure**
- `questions` to define **motion vector**
