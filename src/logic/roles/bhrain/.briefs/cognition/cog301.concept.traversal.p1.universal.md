# 🧭 .brief: concept.treestruct.traversal

## .what
The **concept.treestruct.traversal** model defines the three fundamental directions of **semantic movement** in the universal rootball:

1. **radial** — abstraction and specialization
2. **lateral** — peer-to-peer comparison at the same depth
3. **angular** — cross-axis shifts, often involving metaphor, analogy, or re-framing

These directions describe how a thinker or system can **navigate** from one concept to another — based not on static position, but on the **path taken through meaning**.

---

## .why

Modeling traversal is essential for:

- distinguishing between **structural motion** and **semantic drift**
- grounding metaphor and analogy in measurable displacements
- explaining how conceptual reasoning moves from point to point
- linking relative and universal perspectives through common mechanics

Traversal defines the **vectors of thought** in concept space.

## .modes of traversal

### 🌀 radial traversal

> Move toward or away from the core concept: `"concept"`

- **inward** = abstraction (generalization, simplification)
- **outward** = specification (elaboration, detail)
- controlled by `focal.depth`
- radial motion defines how far a concept is from the root

📌 this is the **primary axis of compression**
📌 motion is often hierarchical or categorical in nature

---

### ↔️ lateral traversal

> Move across peer concepts at the same level of abstraction

- explores conceptual **neighbors**
- often used in comparison, substitution, clustering
- measured by `focal.breadth`
- lateral motion assumes local semantic coherence

📌 when semantic angle is small, **angular ≈ lateral**
📌 often invisible in thought — we "drift" between peers seamlessly

---

### 🔀 angular traversal

> Shift semantic direction — change frame, domain, or axis

- may involve:
  - domain switching (e.g. taxonomy → function)
  - role shifting (e.g. `"dog"` as animal → `"dog"` as servant)
  - metaphor (e.g. `"knife"` ↔ `"word"`)
  - analogical reasoning
- often includes **radial changes** as side-effects
- angular motion is less linear — more like a **semantic curve**

📌 angular motion is the **engine of creative, lateral, symbolic thought**
📌 enables pattern recognition, schema transfer, and reframing

---

## .gradient boundary

> The boundary between lateral and angular traversal is **not discrete**.

- when angular displacement is small, lateral ≈ angular
- when axis/frame changes, angular ≠ lateral
- key distinction: **does the movement preserve semantic orientation or reframe it?**

---

## .compound traversal

Most real traversal is **blended**:

- `"banana"` → `"apple"` → `"fruit"` → `"snack"` → `"joke"` → `"banana phone"`

This path includes:
- lateral (apple)
- radial-in (fruit)
- radial-out (snack)
- angular (joke)
- angular again (banana as visual pun)

📌 traversal chains accumulate displacement
📌 over time, they drift semantically and structurally

---

## .notes

- traversal ≠ position — it's **semantic movement**
- traversal defines how we **think**, **search**, **compare**, and **reinterpret**
- all traversal occurs within the **universal RootStruct**, but may be framed **relatively** or **fractally**

> Concepts are not just things to describe — they are places to move between.
