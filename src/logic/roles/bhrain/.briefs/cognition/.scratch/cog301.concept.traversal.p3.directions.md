# 🧭 .brief: concept.traversal.directions

## .what
**concept.traversal.directions** defines the **axes of movement** across a `concept.treestruct` — representing the **semantic paths** along which a mind or system may navigate, abstract, compare, or elaborate meanings.

Each axis captures a **distinct mode of generalization or relation**, structuring how concepts cluster and evolve across the conceptual terrain.

---

## 🧠 comment
There is a **set of common traversal axes** that appear across human language, categorization, and reasoning. These directions can **intersect**, allowing a single concept to move outward or inward in **multiple dimensions simultaneously**.

## 📐 common semantic directions of traversal

| axis             | abstraction path                                  | how it generalizes             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **categorical**  | `"dog"` → `"mammal"` → `"animal"`                | by type or membership          |
| **functional**   | `"email"` → `"message"` → `"communication"`      | by purpose or behavior         |
| **ontological**  | `"emotion"` → `"neural state"` → `"event"`       | by kind of being               |
| **capability**   | `"can walk"` → `"has mobility"` → `"has agency"` | by possibility or constraint   |
| **emotional**    | `"fear"` → `"negative affect"` → `"alert signal"`| by affective tone              |
| **causal**       | `"match"` → `"ignition"` → `"fire source"`       | by mechanism or influence      |

## 🧩 notes

- These directions are often **interwoven** — real-world traversal might follow a **braid of axes**.
- They define **local gradients** within the `concept.treestruct`, shaping how concepts relate and flow.
- Each direction may support both:
  - **abstraction** (inward traversal)
  - **elaboration** (outward traversal)
