# ðŸ§­ .brief: concept.treestruct.traversal

## .what

**Traversal** defines the two fundamental **dimensions of semantic movement** within the **spherical concept.treestruct**:

1. **abstractive** â€” moves **inward or outward** along abstraction
   â†’ generalization (coreward) or specialization (edgeward)
2. **descriptive** â€” moves **across descriptive variation**
   â†’ comparisons, substitutions, analogies, or re-frames at similar abstraction level

These dimensions describe how thinkers or systems **navigate meaning**,
not just by position, but by **semantic motion** between nodes â€” driven by questions-as-links.

---

## .why

Modeling traversal enables:

- describing thought as motion rather than static position
- grounding reasoning chains, analogies, and metaphors in geometry
- unifying `focal.depth` and `focal.breadth` under a coherent spatial model
- reducing cognitive complexity by collapsing traversal into **two main axes**
- anchoring complex reasoning in **simple directionality**

## .primary dimensions

### ðŸŒ€ abstractive traversal

> Move **inward** or **outward** along the abstraction axis

- **inward** = abstraction â†’ generalization, simplification
- **outward** = specialization â†’ instantiation, elaboration
- governed by `focal.depth`
- follows hierarchy: leaf â†’ branch â†’ root

ðŸ“Œ represents **radial compression**
ðŸ“Œ defines a node's distance from the semantic core

---

### ðŸ§­ descriptive traversal

> Move **across descriptive space** at the same abstraction level

- includes:
  - **lateral** shifts â†’ peer-to-peer comparison (e.g. "apple" â†” "banana")
  - **cross-axis** shifts â†’ role, function, tone, domain (e.g. "banana" â†” "energy bar")
- governed by `focal.breadth`
- explores conceptual variation across **descriptive dimensions**
  (flavor, function, emotion, category, etc.)

ðŸ“Œ descriptive motion ranges from simple (substitution) to complex (analogy, metaphor)
ðŸ“Œ supports both **comparison** and **reinterpretation**

## .gradient distinction

Descriptive motion exists on a **gradient**:

| subtype       | description                                   | example                        |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **lateral**   | same axis, peer instance                      | `"banana"` â†” `"apple"`         |
| **cross-axis**| different axis, descriptive reframe           | `"banana"` â†” `"joke"`          |
| **analogical**| abstract pattern match across contexts        | `"battery"` â†” `"stomach"`      |

â†’ All are descriptive traversal; complexity increases with axis and abstractive thickness.

## .compound traversal

Real navigation is rarely pure.
A single thought path may span both dimensions:

**example:**
\`\`\`
"banana" â†’ "apple" â†’ "fruit" â†’ "snack" â†’ "joke" â†’ "banana phone"
\`\`\`

This includes:

- **lateral** â†’ "apple"
- **abstractive (in)** â†’ "fruit"
- **abstractive (out)** â†’ "snack"
- **descriptive shift** â†’ "joke"
- **pattern match** â†’ "banana phone"

ðŸ“Œ traversal chains create **semantic drift** over time
ðŸ“Œ complex ideas often emerge through **interdimensional motion**

---

## .notes

- traversal â‰  position â€” it is **semantic motion** across concept space
- all traversal is triggered by **questions-as-links** â€” semantic prompts between nodes
- the **spherical concept.treestruct** supports recursive motion along both axes
- abstractive and descriptive are the **two primary dimensions** of reasoning motion

> Donâ€™t just ask where a concept is â€”
> ask **how to move from it**, and **why youâ€™d go there**.
