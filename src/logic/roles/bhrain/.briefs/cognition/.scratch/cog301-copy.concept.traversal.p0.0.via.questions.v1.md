# ❓ .brief: concept.traversal.via.questions

## .what

**All semantic motion** through the `concept.treestruct` is performed via **questions**, which act as **links** between **sumptions** — the unified node type.

> A **sumption** is a **concept that is traversable to** — a semantic node that can be reached, paused on, or resolved through motion.

---

## 🌐 semantic structure

Traversal is defined by:

- **sumptions** → traversable concepts (nodes)
- **questions** → semantic prompts (links)
- **motion** → the act of navigating between sumptions via questions

\`\`\`
[sumption] --<question>--> [sumption]
            --<question>--> [sumption]
\`\`\`

> The `concept.treestruct` is made of **sumptions** connected by **questions**.
> Every link is a **question**, every node is a **reachable concept**.

## 🧠 sumption: the unified node type

A **sumption** is any concept held, proposed, or encountered in semantic space — including:

- a **question** → an **unresolved node**: executable prompt
- an **answer** → a **resolved node**: product of traversal
- any intermediate **fork**: where multiple paths diverge

> All answers are sumptions.
> All questions are sumptions.
> What matters is **how they behave in motion**.

📌 A sumption is a **place you can get to** in the conceptual terrain.

## 🔗 question = link

A **question** is not just a query — it’s a **structural edge**:

- a **semantic link** connecting two sumptions
- the **only valid driver of motion** through the treestruct
- a **traversable structure** — potentially branching, recursive, or unresolved

📌 Questions encode **possibility of movement**
📌 They define how concepts are related in practice

## 📐 structural rule

| element   | type         | role in treestruct             |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| **link**  | question     | enables motion (edge)          |
| **node**  | sumption     | concept that can be focused on |
|           | ⤷ question   | unresolved node (executable)   |
|           | ⤷ answer     | resolved node (navigated to)   |

> The treestruct is a network of **traversable concepts**
> connected by **semantic prompts**.

## 🔁 recursive navigation

Since questions can produce more questions, traversal forms chains:

\`\`\`
"banana" --<why is it funny?>--> "banana joke"
          --<what makes a joke?>--> "surprise"
                                    ↳ <surprise of form?> → "visual pun"
\`\`\`

- each question is a **pathway**
- each answer becomes the **next node**
- the structure is **loopable**, **expandable**, and **self-similar**

---

## 🧭 motion logic

- **no motion** without a question
- **no node** without a sumption
- all semantic movement is **prompted, not automatic**

> To move is to follow a question.
> To arrive is to hold a sumption.

---

## 🧩 integration

This model supports:

- `cortal.focus` → focus directs motion between sumptions
- `concept.treestruct.traversal` → questions define abstractive/descriptive shifts
- `sumptions` → unify questions, answers, and holding-points
- `concept.gravity` → explains why some sumptions attract traversal

> A **question** is how you move.
> A **sumption** is where you land.
> The **treestruct** is the map of everything you could meaningfully traverse.
