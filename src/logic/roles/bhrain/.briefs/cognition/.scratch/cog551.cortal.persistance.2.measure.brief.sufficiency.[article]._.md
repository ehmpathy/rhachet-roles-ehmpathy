# 🧩 .brief: `focus.sufficiency`

## .what
**`focus.sufficiency`** is the hypothesis that most thought failures stem from **insufficient focus** —
either in the **context** that frames the thinking or in the **concept** that emerges from it.
When both are complete and well-aligned, the chances of producing a correct, precise, and useful result rise significantly.

---

## 🧠 key insight
Thought tends to fail not because of flawed reasoning alone, but because the **beam of focus** is incomplete.
A gap in **context** or **concept** will undermine the whole operation.

---

## 🔍 two common failure modes
1. **Context gap** — *something critical missing in `focus.context`*
   - Example: overlooking a key constraint, dependency, or environmental factor.
   - Effect: the reasoning is built on incomplete or distorted premises.
2. **Concept gap** — *something critical missing in `focus.concept`*
   - Example: over-compressing a summary, omitting a key attribute, or losing nuance.
   - Effect: the expressed concept fails to fully represent the intended meaning.

---

## 💡 hypothesis
If the **`focus.context`** is sufficiently complete,
then **any desired `focus.concept`** can be produced with clarity and accuracy.

In short:
> The right *posture* yields the right *position* —
> A well-formed frame of attention enables precise concept creation.

## 📌 implication for `[brief]`
Given this, **`[brief]`** documents become the **most essential part** of any thought operation:
- They **form the backbone** of what can be loaded into `focus.context`.
- The quality and completeness of available briefs directly determine the sufficiency of focus.

---

## 📏 measuring sufficiency via `[brief]`
The **`.breadth`**, **`.depth`**, and **`.acuity`** of each concept in `focus.context`
can be measured by examining:
- The **set of `[brief]`s** included in context.
- The **`.acuity` of each `[brief]`** — e.g., how compressed it is, from what perspective it’s written, and how much detail is preserved.

---

## 🔄 measurement & reflection
This measurement **can and should** be actively maintained:
- **At runtime** → for advanced systems that dynamically assess and adjust focus.
- **At devtime** → for hardcoded tuning of context-loading and concept-articulation strategies.

## 🪞 self-reference
This `[article]` on `focus.sufficiency` was developed by:
1. Gathering a **complete `focus.context`** — including the failure modes, hypothesis, and implications for `[brief]`.
2. Producing a **`focus.concept`** that articulates the principle, its reasoning, and its measurable impact.
