# 🌳 .brief: concept.treestruct

## .what
The **concept.treestruct** is a semantic structure where concepts are arranged as interconnected nodes, radiating outward from a central **abstract core**. It enables movement toward **abstraction**, **specialization**, **peer clusters**, and **cross-cut analogies**.

Rather than a strict hierarchy, it frames concept space as a **radial structure**, compatible with **cognitive optics** — allowing navigation by **inward**, **outward**, **lateral**, or **radial** motion.

---

## .why
This structure enables rich, optically-grounded reasoning:

- abstraction and specialization become **directional movements**
- supports **semantic compression** (inward) and **expansion** (outward)
- mirrors how humans traverse ideas: inward for essence, outward for richness, lateral for alternatives
- aligns with **focal modeling**: depth, acuity, and breadth of conceptual view

---

## .directions
In a **radial TreeStruct**, semantic movement operates as follows:

- **inward** → abstraction
  - move toward the **core**, discovering more general and inclusive concepts
  - e.g. `"border collie"` → `"herding dog"` → `"dog"` → `"mammal"`

- **outward** → specialization
  - move toward the **periphery**, surfacing more specific and richly featured forms
  - e.g. `"tool"` → `"cutting tool"` → `"knife"` → `"surgical scalpel"`

- **lateral** → clustering
  - move across **peer concepts** at the same abstraction radius
  - e.g. `"dog"` ↔ `"cat"` ↔ `"rabbit"` (all mammals)

- **radial** → cross-linking
  - form connections across **branches** by shared traits, metaphors, or function
  - e.g. `"knife"` ↔ `"word"` (both cut), `"wolf"` ↔ `"dog"` (shared ancestry)

---

## .geometry
In this model, the **TreeStruct is unbounded** — its radial space is **conceptually infinite**, allowing for unlimited specialization in every direction. As a result:

- **angular displacement** becomes indistinguishable from **lateral traversal** at a given radius
- thus, **lateral movement** can be treated as **linear shifts** across a conceptual ring, rather than rotational movement
- this simplifies navigation: we treat sibling concepts as peers on a **semantic belt** surrounding the core

> Lateral ≈ angular in the limit of infinite conceptual circumference.

---

## .metaphor
Think of a **semantic compass rose**:

- zoom **inward** to distill a concept’s core identity
- zoom **outward** to explore its specialized expressions
- pan **laterally** to find neighbors
- rotate **radially** to detect hidden links

---

## .example

Starting at the concept **“dog”**:

- **inward**: `"dog"` → `"mammal"` → `"animal"` → `"organism"`
- **outward**: `"dog"` → `"herding dog"` → `"border collie"` → `"tri-colored border collie"`
- **lateral**: `"dog"` ↔ `"cat"` ↔ `"rabbit"`
- **radial**:
  - `"dog"` ↔ `"wolf"` (evolutionary origin)
  - `"dog"` ↔ `"servant"` (functional analogy)
  - `"dog"` ↔ `"vehicle"` (storytelling metaphor: loyalty or conveyance)

---

## .struct
- all concepts are **nodes** in a radial TreeStruct
- nodes may belong to **multiple branches** simultaneously
- structure supports **zoom**, **focus**, **lateral pan**, and **frame shift** operations
- movement is **directional**, not strictly hierarchical — more like navigating a conceptual map

---

## .notes
This model integrates with **cortal.focus mechanics**:
- `focal.depth` governs **how abstract** or **concrete** the concept in view is
- `focal.acuity` controls **how granular** the current layer’s detail is
- `focal.breadth` defines **how many sibling/radial paths** are held in view

> Concepts are not fixed points — they are **navigable positions** in a dynamic, radial **tree of meaning**.
