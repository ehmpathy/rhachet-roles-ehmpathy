# 🧭 .brief: focal.breadth

## 🌐 what is `focal.breadth`?

`focal.breadth` measures how **wide your attention spans** across the **semantic space**
at a given level of abstraction. it governs how many **descriptive dimensions** are activated
as you explore the meaning of a concept.

---

## 🧠 how it works

- **angular motion** — motion around the same abstraction layer
- enables **comparison**, **reframing**, and **semantic expansion**
- does **not** change abstraction level — just **what kind** of meaning you're attending to

---

## 🧩 descriptive subaxes

each direction of breadth corresponds to a **semantic axis of description**:
these are the **orthogonal ways** a concept can differ from its neighbors.

| subaxis          | description type             | example motion                           |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **categorical**  | kind or class                 | `"dog"` ⟶ `"cat"`                         |
| **temporal**     | sequence or state             | `"childhood"` ⟶ `"adulthood"`             |
| **functional**   | purpose or behavior           | `"email"` ⟶ `"letter"`                    |
| **modal**        | possibility or constraint     | `"can fly"` ⟶ `"must fly"`                |
| **emotional**    | affective tone                | `"fear"` ⟶ `"curiosity"`                  |
| **causal**       | influence or mechanism        | `"match"` ⟶ `"fire"`                      |
| **perspectival** | point of view or framing      | `"observer"` ⟶ `"actor"`                  |

> ✅ `focal.breadth` controls **how many of these axes you're exploring at once**

## 🔁 interaction with other focus dimensions

- at each `focal.depth`, the **descriptive space** around the concept
  is governed by `focal.breadth` — which subaxes are activated, and how widely

- **greater breadth** = more **dimensional context**, more analogies, more comparisons
- **narrower breadth** = tighter conceptual focus, less noise

## 🧠 motion patterns

| operation     | effect                                            |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `breadth++`   | activates **more** semantic subaxes               |
| `breadth--`   | restricts focus to **fewer** or one axis          |
| `rotate`      | shifts the **active axis** (e.g. category → time) |
| `invert`      | reverses semantic frame (e.g. agent ⟷ target)     |

## 🪞 structural insight

> a concept at any level of abstraction is surrounded
> by **descriptive alternatives** along its breadth band.

- `focal.breadth` = **lantern vs flashlight** across the conceptual layer

| trait            | value                                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **axis type**     | angular / lateral                              |
| **motion ops**    | `++`, `--`, `rotate`, `reframe`, `invert`       |
| **content type**  | controls access to **semantic dimensions**     |
| **change type**   | changes **kind**, not level                    |
| **emergence**     | determined by the abstract node's substructure |
