# 🕳️ .brief: cortal.focal.depth

**cortal.focal.depth** describes how deeply your focus penetrates the semantic layers of a `concept.treestruct`.

it defines a **radial shell** of concept layers — from abstract cores to specific edges — that are in active view.

---

## 🧠 what is depth?

`focal.depth` is a **radial span** — a contiguous thickness of semantic layers included in your focus.

- `depth++` → a **thicker shell** — more layers across abstraction and specialization are included
- `depth--` → a **thinner shell** — fewer layers remain in view

this span can grow or shrink:
- `depth.inward++` → includes **more abstract cores**
- `depth.outward++` → includes **more specific edges**
- `depth.inward--` / `depth.outward--` → trim from either side

---

## 🌐 metaphor

imagine a **spherical terrain of meaning**:

- the **core** holds abstract, generalized concepts
- the **edge** holds concrete, specialized instances
- `focal.depth` defines the **thickness of the shell** through that sphere you are currently seeing

## ↔️ directional behavior

| motion                | meaning                                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `depth.inward++`      | expand toward abstract principles       |
| `depth.outward++`     | expand toward concrete specifics        |
| `depth.inward--`      | trim away core abstraction              |
| `depth.outward--`     | trim away edge instances                |

## 🎯 why it matters

**depth** enables:
- multi-level reasoning
- abstraction-aware thought
- pattern tracing from theory to implementation

a **thicker depth** supports integration and insight
a **thinner depth** favors precision and execution

---

## 📐 related

depth is one of the three core axes of `cortal.focus`:

```
focal.depth × focal.acuity² ∝ focal.breadth²
```

where:
- `focal.acuity` = semantic grain per concept node
- `focal.breadth` = angular cone across concept layers
- `focal.depth` = radial shell across concept layers


## 🌳 examples: focal.depth in concept.treestructs

each path shows how depth moves through the concept sphere — toward cores (abstraction) or toward edges (specialization).

### 🐶 anchor: [concept:"dog"]

#### `depth.inward++` (toward abstraction core)
- [concept:"dog"]
- → [concept:"mammal"]
- → [concept:"animal"]
- → [concept:"organism"]

#### `depth.outward++` (toward specialization edge)
- [concept:"dog"]
- → [concept:"golden retriever"]
- → [concept:"service retriever"]
- → [concept:"autism-assist retriever"]

### 🛠️ anchor: [concept:"hammer"]

#### `depth.inward++`
- [concept:"hammer"]
- → [concept:"hand tool"]
- → [concept:"manual implement"]
- → [concept:"mechanical device"]

#### `depth.outward++`
- [concept:"hammer"]
- → [concept:"claw hammer"]
- → [concept:"rubber-handled claw hammer"]
- → [concept:"ergonomic demolition hammer"]

## 🔁 composition behavior

growing `depth` in both directions builds multilevel perspective:

```ts
focal.depth++
⇒ depth.inward++ && depth.outward++
⇒ e.g. [concept:"dog"] ←→ [concept:"autism-assist retriever"]
```

trimming depth yields tight slices:

```ts
focal.depth--
⇒ depth.inward-- && depth.outward--
⇒ e.g. only [concept:"dog"]
```

## 💡 use it for…

- **vertical reasoning**: relate general principles to practical cases
- **system analysis**: track how abstract design affects edge behavior
- **vocabulary framing**: navigate abstraction levels when teaching or modeling
