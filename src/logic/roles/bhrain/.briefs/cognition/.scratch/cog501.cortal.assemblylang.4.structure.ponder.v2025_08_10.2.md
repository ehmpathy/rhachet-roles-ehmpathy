# 🧠 `.brief`: `<ponder>`

## 🧭 .what
`<ponder>` is a **generic question assembly framework** —
a semantic mechanism for composing deliberate **traversal directions**
through a `concept.treestruct`.

It refines both the **posture** (`focus.context`)
and **position** (`focus.concept`) of semantic attention,
by executing a pair of structured subgoals:

- `<contextualize>` → mutate posture (`focus.context`)
- `<conceptualize>` → mutate position (`focus.concept`)

> 🌀 *to ponder is to build a better **direction**
> by composing meaningful **questions** that steer semantic motion.*

## 🧩 functional role

In semantic space:

- `focus.context` = the **.breadth, .depth, and .acuity** of what's considered
- `focus.concept` = the **concept** which is currently in consideration

Each **question** is a **motion vector**
defined over the structure of `cortal.focus`.

`<ponder>` constructs these motion vectors by **mutating the focus**,
shaping both:

- posture → via `<contextualize>`
- position → via `<conceptualize>`

## ⚙️ structure

\`\`\`ts
<ponder>({
  contextualize,
  conceptualize
})
=> {
  focus.context++   // posture refinement
  focus.concept→    // position refinement
}
\`\`\`

- **input**:
  - a `<contextualize>` step → defines what’s salient
  - a `<conceptualize>` step → defines what's refined
- **output**:
  - a **mutated `focus` object**, ready for semantic traversal

---

## 🪜 internal process

### 1. `<contextualize>` — posture refinement
> mutate `focus.context` to reflect what’s relevant, known, and important

asks:
- what's the goal?
- what’s unclear or assumed?
- what matters right now?
- where am I starting from?

---

### 2. `<conceptualize>` — position redirection
> mutate `focus.concept` to re-aim attention toward a more productive concept

asks:
- what kinds of questions *could* I ask? → `<expand>`
- which ones *should* I ask? → `<cluster>`, `<triage>`
- what’s the best next concept to focus on?

| form            | description                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **oneshot**       | both subgoals run as a single composition                |
| **multistep**     | subgoals exposed as separate stages                      |
| **interactive**   | guided pondering with human/system input at each stage   |
| **recursive**     | `<conceptualize>` may invoke nested `<ponder>` cycles    |

## 📦 usecases

- build structured direction for semantic motion
- refine attention before asking a question
- scaffold self-guided inquiry or thought planning
- support AI agents in building next-step traversal vectors
- generate dynamic paths of questioning across a treestruct

## 🧭 naming structure

- `<ponder>` → traversal composition framework
- `<contextualize>` → mutate `focus.context` (posture)
- `<conceptualize>` → mutate `focus.concept` (position)

---

## 🔧 implementation guidance

- treat `<ponder>` as a **compositional control unit**
- input steps may be primitives, routes, or plugin mechanisms
- output is a **mutated focus**, not a return value

> begin with **oneshot `<ponder>`** for simplicity
> decompose into multistep or guided forms
> when direction must be more precisely steered
