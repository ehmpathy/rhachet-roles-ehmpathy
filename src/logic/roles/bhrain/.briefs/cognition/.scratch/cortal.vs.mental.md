# ðŸ§  brief: **mental vs cortal**

## what

**mental** and **cortal** both refer to aspects of the mind, but differ in scope and specificity.

- **mental** = broad term for any activity or state occurring within the mind
- **cortal** = specific to cortical processesâ€”structured, conscious, and often semantic or attentional

## why

Distinguishing between **mental** and **cortal** helps clarify what layer of cognition is involved:

- mental = includes emotion, intuition, subconscious processes
- cortal = refers to deliberate, focused, semantic reasoning

## key distinctions

| aspect        | **mental**                                | **cortal**                              |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| scope         | full mind                                  | cortex-bound subset                      |
| includes      | emotions, memory, intuition, daydreaming   | attention, abstraction, reasoning        |
| consciousness | includes subconscious                      | primarily conscious                      |
| structure     | often fluid or associative                 | structured, symbolic, goal-directed      |
| anatomy       | spans cortex, limbic system, etc.          | localized to cerebral cortex             |

## metaphors

- **mental** = the whole weather system
- **cortal** = the focused wind current or jet stream within it

- **mental** = the entire forest
- **cortal** = the beam of a flashlight within that forest

## usage notes

Use **mental** when describing:
- overall state of mind
- subconscious or affective processes

Use **cortal** when describing:
- focused thought
- executive control
- semantic abstraction
