# üñºÔ∏è [gallery]: `<ponder> in <enquestion>` ‚Äî leaking kitchen sink

## üîß scenario
A plumber is diagnosing a **kitchen sink leak**.
`<enquestion>` takes **input = { ponder, focus }** where:
- `focus.concept` = the **current state of the questions** (seed list; may start empty)
- `focus.context` = the **situation**, and it **must include `.goal`**

  ponder: {

      "What facts are missing to start a safe test?",
      "What has changed since the sink last worked?"
    ],

      "Which components are plausible sources given the symptom pattern?",
      "What minimal tests can discriminate among those sources?"

### ‚úÖ prompt output

\`\`\`ts
{
  ponder: {
    contextualize: {
      "What facts are missing to start a safe test?":
        "We need to know if leak occurs with hot, cold, or both; whether it appears only during drain flow; and if any fittings are visibly wet.",
      "What has changed since the sink last worked?":
        "Faucet replaced last month; disposal installed two years ago; no recent drain clogs."
    },
    conceptualize: {
      "Which components are plausible sources given the symptom pattern?":
        "Supply lines (hot/cold), faucet base, P-trap/compression joints, dishwasher/disposal connections.",
      "What minimal tests can discriminate among those sources?":
        "Pressurized supply test (no flow), faucet-on/no-drain test, drain-only full-basin dump."
    }
  },

  produce: {
    questions: {
      contextualize: [
        "When did the leak first appear?",
        "Has any work been done recently (faucet, disposal)?",
        "Does the cabinet get wet with supply pressurized but faucet OFF?",
        "Is moisture at the faucet base after 30s ON with no drain flow?",
        "Which trap joint wets first during a full-basin dump?"
      ],
      conceptualize: [
        "Which components fit the observed pattern (supply, faucet base, trap, disposal line)?",
        "Which minimal test isolates each hypothesis?",
        "What repair steps correspond to each confirmed source?"
      ]
    }

### üí° why this works
- **parallel structure** between `ponder` and `produce.questions` keeps reasoning and output aligned.
- **input.focus.concept** stores the *current* contextualize/conceptualize sets.
- **output.ponder** reshapes understanding; **output.produce.questions** is the refined, ready-to-use set.
