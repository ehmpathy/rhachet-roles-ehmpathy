# 🧾 .brief: `[brief]`

## .what
A **brief** is a **[concept] persistence format** — stored in `.md` for maximum **portability**, **maintainability**, and **observability**.
It is intended for **both human and robot consumption**, with a focus on clarity and structural consistency.

---

## 🎯 goal
**Maximize signal-to-noise** by distilling concepts into a structured, minimal, yet complete reference.
A brief should be **self-contained** enough for standalone use, but also linkable within a wider catalog of knowledge.

---

## 🔄 refinement pattern
Briefs evolve through a **branch-out** → **bubble-back** cycle:

- **branch-out** → `<elaborate>` into richer forms:
  - `<instantiate>` → surface examples
  - `<catalogize>` → organize related elements
  - `<articulate>` → refine definitions & relations
- **bubble-back** → `<triage>` and `<compress>` to prune noise and sharpen clarity
  - results **back-propagate** to update the core brief, polished over time through practice

## 📚 variants of `[brief]` (cataloged so far)

| variant       | focus scope          | method           | output type |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **[article]** | berries (concepts)   | `<articulate>`   | [article]   |
| **[catalog]** | branches (relations) | `<catalogize>`   | [catalog]   |
| **[gallery]** | examples             | `<instantiate>`  | [gallery]   |

## ⚙️ generation
`<enbrief>` is a generic request to **create a [brief]**.
The variant(s) to produce are **judged at runtime** based on context, goal, and available material.

## 🪞 elemental primitive of concept materialization

the **[brief]** is an **elemental primitive** —
- **elemental**: present in every domain where ideas are brought into form
- **primitive**: the smallest indivisible unit for materializing a concept

its role is **concept materialization**: taking something abstract and giving it a concrete, persistent shape.
because this shape endures, it naturally becomes part of the system’s memory.

a **[brief]** can even instantiate itself, producing:
- **[article]** — a direct declaration of what a [brief] is and how it works
- **[catalog]** — a structured list of its own variants
- **[gallery]** — examples of itself in action

this **closure under self-application** is the hallmark of an elemental primitive:
it performs its defining operation **on itself** without needing anything more fundamental.
in doing so, it can:
- describe itself
- organize itself
- exemplify itself

making it **universally applicable**, **self-sustaining**, and the **seed from which larger structures grow**.
