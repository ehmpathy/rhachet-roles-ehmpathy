most thought fails due to insufficient focus
- either something was missed in context (e.g., key constraint)
- or
- something was missed in articulation (e.g., summarized too much, missed a key attribute)

the hypothesis is that
- with the right focus.context
- then
- you can produce any focus.concept


---

given that

then .breifs become the most essential part of any thought operation

since they form the backbone of what can be loaded into context


---

specifically,

- .breadth, .depth, .acuity of each concept in focus.context can be measured via briefs included and .acuity of each .brief (e.g., how compressed, from what perspective, etc)


---

this can and should be measured & reflected upon
- at runtime, for advanced systems
- at devtime, for hardcoded tunage
