# 🌐 .brief: concept.treestruct.rootball

## .what
The **concept.treestruct.rootball** is the universal semantic substrate — a global **RootStruct** of interconnected concepts radiating from a single ultimate core: `concept`.

All semantic navigation occurs within this infinite, nested, radial space. Local TreeStructs (domain-specific hierarchies) are simply **branches**, **lenses**, or **overlay structures** within this shared conceptual rootball.

---

## .why
This framing reconciles multiple perspectives:

- ensures **every concept** is ultimately linked through abstraction to a common core
- enables **relative reasoning** from any focal point
- allows for **intersecting domains** without fragmentation
- supports **traversal**: **radial**, **lateral**, **angular**

---

## .perspectives

### 🟢 universal (absolute view)
- the entire concept space is a **single infinite sphere** rooted in `concept`
- `focal.depth` = **radial distance from the core**
  → governs level of abstraction vs specificity
- `focal.breadth` = **lateral spread** around current radius
  → governs number of peer/radial options in view
- all TreeStructs live within this one RootStruct

### 🔵 relative (focal view)
- from any concept node, movement can be interpreted as:
  - **radial**: inwards (abstraction) or outwards (specialization)
  - **lateral**: across peer concepts (same radius)
  - **angular**: metaphor, analogy, or axis-shifting — often with a radial component
- useful for **local reasoning**, **zooming**, and **frame shifting**

### 🟣 intersecting TreeStructs (domain lenses)
- domains (e.g. `taxonomy`, `function`, `story.role`) define their own TreeStructs
- these TreeStructs **share nodes** but differ in branching logic
- intersections allow concepts to appear in **multiple hierarchies simultaneously**
- e.g. `"dog"` belongs to both `"mammal"` (biological) and `"companion"` (narrative)

---

## .traversal
Defined movement types:

- **radial** = inward (abstraction) or outward (specialization)
  → movement along the semantic radius
- **lateral** = nearby concepts at the same radial depth
  → peer shifts, neighbors, same domain or axis
- **angular** = directional leap that bypasses local lateral space
  → often crosses domains, metaphor, or re-axes the focal frame
  → typically includes **radial + semantic axis change**

---

## .geometry
The rootball is an **infinite radial space**. Navigation is defined by:

- `focal.depth` → **radial motion** (toward or away from the core)
- `focal.breadth` → **lateral motion** (angular sweep at current radius)
- `focal.acuity` → **resolution** at the current layer (grain of detail)

> lateral ≈ angular in the limit of infinite radius — unless the semantic axis shifts

---

## .core
The **universal root** of the structure is the concept: `"concept"`
All trees, domains, and meanings converge upon this anchor.
> Even seemingly unrelated domains collapse upward to a shared semantic origin.

---

## .examples

- `"dog"` can be explored:
  - via **taxonomy**: `"dog"` ← `"mammal"` ← `"animal"`
  - via **role**: `"dog"` ← `"companion"` ← `"servant"`
  - via **function**: `"dog"` ← `"guardian"` ← `"protector"`
  - via **symbol**: `"dog"` ↔ `"vehicle"` (loyalty metaphor)

- `"knife"` ↔ `"word"` (both can "cut")
  → an **angular** shift with **cross-domain radial re-rooting**

---

## .notes
This model supports:

- **semantic zoom** across multiple dimensions
- **domain mapping** without isolation
- **radial reasoning**, **lateral comparison**, and **angular frame-shifting**
- clear distinction between:
  - the **universal rootball**
  - local **TreeStructs** (lenses)
  - **relative perspective** (focal anchor)

> The rootball is not a single tree — it's a woven structure of intersecting hierarchies grounded in a shared conceptual core.
