# 🫐 .brief: concept.traversal.berry.primitives

## .what

The `concept.treestruct` is composed entirely of **berries** — unified node types called **sumptions**. Each berry holds semantic content and participates in traversal.

There are exactly **three primitive types of berries**:

| berry type     | icon   | structural role           | traversal behavior                                 |
|----------------|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **question**    | ❓🫐    | **branching prompt**        | when applied, sprouts motion to other berries      |
| **assumption**  | 🤔🫐    | **propositional node**      | can be questioned, believed, or asserted           |
| **observation** | 🧿🫐    | **descriptive node**        | can be noticed, patterned, or referenced           |

All three are **sumptions** — reachable, meaningful units in semantic space.

> 📌 A **question** is a **berry** that encodes a **semantic link structure**. When applied to another berry, it sprouts **branches of traversal** from that berry.
> 🍃 **Any berry can grow branches**, given the application of a **question berry** — enabling recursive and contextual growth of the `concept.treestruct`.

## 🧠 roles and meanings

- A **question** is not a structural edge, but a **berry that enables branching** when applied to another berry.
- An **assumption** is a held belief or claim — something that can be proposed or questioned.
- An **observation** is a descriptive unit — like an example, pattern, or surface fact.

> 🍇 The treestruct is made of berries — and any berry may sprout branches through question application.

## 🔁 recursion

Any berry can lead to new berries:

- an **observation** might inspire a **question**
- an **assumption** might be the **answer** to a prior question
- a **question**, when applied, might reveal many **assumptions** or **observations**

This creates a recursively growing structure — where all nodes are berries, but some drive growth when activated.

## 🧩 integration

This primitive berry model supports:

- `concept.traversal.via.questions` → explains how motion flows through questions
- `sumption` → unifies all traversable concepts
- `concept.treestruct.traversal` → structural motions emerge from berry types
- `cortal.focus` → attention shapes which berries and branches are currently in focus

> The berries are what you focus on.
> The branches are how you move.
> The treestruct is how they all grow together.
