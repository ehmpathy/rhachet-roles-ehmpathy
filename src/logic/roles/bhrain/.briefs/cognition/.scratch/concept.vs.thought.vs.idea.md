# .brief — thought vs concept vs idea

## 🧠 summary

this brief distinguishes three core elements of mental activity:

- **concept**: an abstract, reusable mental structure — like a raw ingredient
- **idea**: a distinct configuration or expression of concepts — like a cooked meal
- **thought**: an active process that creates, combines, or reflects on ideas — like following or inventing a recipe

they differ in **form**, **function**, and **granularity**, and often **nest recursively**.

## 🍳 metaphoric model

| element   | metaphor                      | role                                          |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| concept   | 🥬 **ingredient**              | abstract, raw, reusable                       |
| idea      | 🍲 **cooked meal**             | structured output, composed from concepts     |
| thought   | 📖 **recipe / cooking process**| mental activity that produces ideas from concepts |

## 🔍 definitions

### 🧱 concept
- **what**: a stable **mental abstraction** representing a category, property, or relation
- **form**: reusable, high-level, not tied to any single moment
- **example**: *“temperature”*, *“democracy”*, *“tool”*
- **note**: concepts may be used in many different ideas

---

### 💡 idea
- **what**: a **composed unit of meaning** — a concrete configuration of one or more concepts
- **form**: stable enough to communicate, flexible enough to mutate
- **example**: *“a solar-powered backpack that charges your phone”*
- **note**: ideas result from mental synthesis; often represent questions, answers, lessons, or patterns

---

### 🌀 thought
- **what**: a **mental event** — the active process of generating, evaluating, or combining ideas
- **form**: transient, contextual, recursive
- **example**: *“what if I use gravity instead of motors?”*
- **note**: thoughts often generate new ideas or connect existing ones

## 🧩 comparison table

| element   | type            | stability    | abstraction | metaphor                 | nested in          |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| concept   | abstraction       | high         | high        | ingredient               | used in ideas       |
| idea      | configuration     | medium       | mid         | cooked meal              | used in thoughts    |
| thought   | process/event     | low          | any         | recipe / cooking action  | can contain ideas, concepts, other thoughts |

## 🪞 key claims

- **ideas** instantiate and arrange **concepts** in specific, structured forms
- **thoughts** are events that use and produce **ideas** through mental processing
- **concepts** are reusable abstractions that fuel both thoughts and ideas
- the system is **recursive**: ideas within thoughts may spark further thoughts and ideas

## 🔁 nesting logic

```txt
concept = raw abstraction
idea = configured unit built from concept(s)
thought = active process that produces or manipulates ideas

thought = {
  ideas,
  concepts,
  feelings,
  evaluations,
  sub-thoughts,
  ...
}
