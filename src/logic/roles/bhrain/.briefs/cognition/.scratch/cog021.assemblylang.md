# 🧱 .brief: assembly.language.primitives

## .what
The **primitives of assembly language** are the fundamental building blocks from which all assembly code is composed. They directly correspond to operations and resources exposed by the CPU architecture, offering precise control over computation, memory, and flow.

---

### 🧠 Instruction (Opcode)

The executable command that tells the CPU what to do.

- Examples: `MOV`, `ADD`, `SUB`, `JMP`, `CALL`, `RET`
- Categories: data movement, arithmetic, logic, control flow, stack operations

---

### 🎯 Operand

The input or output target of an instruction.

- Types:
  - **Register** (e.g. `AX`, `R0`)
  - **Immediate** (e.g. `#5`, `$0xFF`)
  - **Memory Address** (e.g. `[1000h]`, `[BP+SI]`)
  - **Label** (for control flow)

---

### 📦 Register

Named hardware-level storage units for temporary data.

- Roles: general-purpose, special-purpose, floating-point
- Architecture-specific: `EAX`, `R1`, `SP`, `PC`, etc.

---

### 🗂️ Memory Access

Mechanisms for reading/writing memory, defined by addressing modes.

- Addressing types:
  - Direct: `[1000h]`
  - Indirect: `[BX]`
  - Indexed: `[BX + SI]`
  - Base + Offset: `[EBP - 4]`

---

### 🔁 Control Flow

Instructions that alter the normal sequence of execution.

- Unconditional jumps: `JMP`
- Conditional branches: `JE`, `JNE`, `JG`, `JL`
- Procedure calls: `CALL`, `RET`
- Loops: `LOOP`, `JNZ`, etc.

---

### 🔢 Constant / Literal

Fixed values embedded in instructions.

- Numeric: `0x10`, `123`, `-5`
- Character: `'A'`, `'\n'`

---

### 📛 Label / Symbol

User-defined names that point to code or data locations.

\\\`\\\`\\\`asm
start:
    MOV AX, BX
    JMP start
\\\`\\\`\\\`

- Used for branching, data reference, procedure naming

---

### ⚙️ Assembler Directive (Pseudo-instruction)

Commands to the **assembler**, not the CPU.

- Used for organizing code, allocating memory, defining constants
- Examples:
  - Section declarations: `.data`, `.text`
  - Storage directives: `.word`, `.byte`, `.ascii`
  - Others: `.global`, `EQU`, `ORG`

---

### 📝 Comment

Annotations for human readers.

- Ignored by the assembler
- Syntax:
  - `; this is a comment` (x86)
  - `@ ARM-style`
  - `# RISC-V / GAS style`

> Together, these primitives form a **minimal language** that maps almost 1:1 with machine code execution.
