# 🎯 .brief: cortal.focus

**Cortal focus** defines how your attention engages with a structured semantic space — it determines:

- **what** concepts are being attended to
- **how precisely** they’re represented
- **how broadly** they’re compared
- **how deeply** they’re compared

This attention mechanism operates over a **concept.treestruct** — a mental terrain of concepts connected by abstraction and similarity. It governs which parts of that structure are actively "in view" at a given moment — and with what clarity and context.

---

## 🌐 where is focus? (terrain: concept.treestruct)

The concept space is modeled as a **radial semantic tree**, not a vertical hierarchy.

Concepts are positioned as nodes radiating from an **abstract core**:

- **inward** = moves toward more **generalized abstractions**, towards the cores
  - e.g. [concept:"entity"] → [concept:"organism"] → [concept:"dog"]
- **outward** = moves toward more **concrete specializations**, towards the edges
  - e.g. [concept:"dog"] → [concept:"golden retriever"] → [concept:"therapy dog"]
- **around** = sweeps laterally across **semantic peers**
  - e.g. [concept:"dog"], [concept:"cat"], [concept:"ferret"]

This radial model provides a spherical terrain — like a globe of meaning — and **cortal focus** defines your cone of attention slicing through it.

## 🔍 what is focus?

Cortal focus is the **intersection of three dimensions**:

- `focal.acuity` → the **semantic grain** of detail at which each concept is resolved
- `focal.breadth` → the **angular cone** of inclusion swept across concept layers
- `focal.depth` → the **radial shell** of concept layers that are included

Together, these shape your **active mental field** — the structure and clarity of what is cognitively “in focus.”

Your attention becomes a **cone-shaped filter** slicing through the layered concept space:
- **how crisply** it sees (`focal.acuity`)
- **how widely** it spreads (`focal.breadth`)
- **how deeply** it reaches (`focal.depth`)

This defines what’s cognitively accessible — and what’s outside your immediate view.

## focal dimensions

---

### 🔬 .focal.acuity

#### .what
Controls the **grain of detail** resolved **within each concept** — i.e., how many semantic dimensions are actively distinguished.

- `acuity++` → resolves fine-grained traits: form, function, variation, context
- `acuity--` → treats the concept as a coarse or holistic whole

> e.g. for [concept:"hammer"]:
> - `acuity++` → tracks:
>   - `head.mass`, `handle.material`, `grip.texture`, `impact.force.shape`
> - `acuity--` → just “thing you hit with”

#### .why
High acuity enables:
- **precision reasoning**
- **design insight**
- **feature-based clustering**

Low acuity supports:
- **fast categorization**
- **loose analogy**
- **cognitive compression**

---

### 🔭 .focal.breadth

#### .what
Controls the **angular cone** of attention at a given radial layer — i.e., how many peer concepts are included at the current depth.

- `breadth++` → **thicker** angular sweep across siblings or cousins
- `breadth--` → **thinner** cone focused on a narrow semantic range

> e.g. at the “pet” layer:
> - thicker: [concept:"dog"], [concept:"cat"], [concept:"rabbit"]
> - thinner: only [concept:"dog"]

#### .why
Thicker breadth enables:
- **semantic triangulation**
- **category contrast**
- **cross-branch discovery**

Thinner breadth supports:
- **focused analysis**
- **depth-first attention**

#### .metaphor
Imagine a **cone expanding outward** from the core of abstraction — breadth is the **angular thickness** of that cone.

---

### 🕳️ .focal.depth

#### .what
Defines the **radial shell** of abstraction levels currently in view — from abstract cores inward to specific cases outward.

- depth is a **thickness**, not a fixed point
- spans a **contiguous range** of conceptual layers, e.g.:
  - [concept:"tool"]
  - → [concept:"cutting tool"]
  - → [concept:"knife"]
  - → [concept:"paring knife"]

- `depth++` → **thicker** radial shell through abstraction
- `depth--` → **thinner** slice of depth

#### .why
Thicker depth enables:
- **vertical integration**
- **multilevel reasoning**
- **abstraction-aware thought**

Thinner depth supports:
- **surface-level fluency**
- **focused categorization**
- **single-layer manipulation**

#### .metaphor
Imagine a **spherical terrain** of meaning — depth is the **radial thickness** of the shell you’re focusing on.

## 📐 compositional tradeoffs

```
focal.depth × focal.acuity² ∝ focal.breadth²
```

where

- `focal.acuity` = **semantic grain** resolved per concept node
- `focal.breadth` = **angular cones** extended from included branches
- `focal.depth` = **radial span** from abstract core to concrete periphery

This expresses how **cognitive focus** is a constrained envelope:
you can focus **deeply**, **finely**, or **widely** — but not all at once without distortion.

### cognitive tradeoffs

- `depth++` + `acuity--` → broad but imprecise vertical intuition
- `acuity++` + `breadth++` → sharp lateral comparison across siblings
- `depth--` + `acuity++` → high-resolution detail within a narrow band
- `breadth++` + `acuity--` → wide conceptual sprawl, low definition
- maxing all leads to **semantic overload** or **blurred coherence**

→ **effective focus requires compositional tuning**, depending on your reasoning goal.

## 🧪 focus profiles

### 🔋 deep + narrow + sharp
*“radial probe”*

#### scenario: studying [concept:"LiFePO₄ battery"]

- `depth++` → spans from [concept:"electron behavior"] → [concept:"battery chemistry"] → [concept:"charging system design"]
- `breadth--` → focuses only on LiFePO₄; ignores NMC, LFP alternatives
- `acuity++` → resolves `tab weld method`, `charge curve shape`, `fuse rating thresholds`
→ **outcome:** vertically integrated understanding, strong for design and troubleshooting within this one system; **not transferable** to others

---

### 🍳 shallow + narrow + sharp
*“precision grip”*

#### scenario: perfecting [concept:"fried egg"]

- `depth--` → no attention to upstream egg types or broader cooking techniques
- `breadth--` → focus restricted to this one dish
- `acuity++` → tracks `pan temperature`, `yolk viscosity`, `edge crispness`, `salt granularity`
→ **outcome:** **refined control** over one specific outcome; **no culinary range**

---

### 🧂 shallow + wide + sharp
*“horizontal analyzer”*

#### scenario: comparing [concept:"cereal brands"]

- `depth--` → surface-level evaluation only
- `breadth++` → considers multiple sibling nodes: [concept:"cheerios"], [concept:"frosted flakes"], [concept:"granola"], [concept:"bran flakes"]
- `acuity++` → compares `price/oz`, `sugar content`, `fiber amount`, `box size`
→ **outcome:** sharp and efficient tradeoff selection; **no insight into nutrition, dietary patterns, or health models**

---

### 🌐 deep + wide + fuzzy
*“system mapper”*

#### scenario: planning [concept:"daily family routine"]

- `depth++` → connects abstract goals ([concept:"quality time"], [concept:"structure"]) to concrete logistics ([concept:"homework"], [concept:"mealtimes"], [concept:"commute"])
- `breadth++` → includes all domains: school, chores, meals, rest, screen time
- `acuity--` → focuses on themes and rhythms, not fine-grained task optimization
→ **outcome:** broad, inclusive schedule reasoning; **not detail-focused** but **strong for systems coherence**
