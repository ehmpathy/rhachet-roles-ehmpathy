# 🌿 .brief: metaphor.traversal.berrybranch

## .what

This metaphor models semantic traversal through a `concept.treestruct` using **just two elements**:

1. **🫐 berry** → a **sumption** — any traversable concept
2. **🌿 branch** → a **question** — a semantic link that fans out to berries

> All motion in the concept space is modeled as **branches growing between berries**.
> All berries are **conceptual nodes** — and may sprout further branches.

📌 This is a metaphorical example of a **cauliflorous structure**, where **fruit (berries)** grow **directly from the trunk or main branches**, just like ideas growing directly from conceptual stems.

## 🧩 mapping to system

| metaphor       | concept.treestruct term | role                                    |
|----------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **🫐 berry**    | `sumption`              | a reachable concept (question or answer)|
| **🌿 branch**   | `question`              | a semantic prompt (link between sumptions) |

Each **berry**:

- is a **node** in the treestruct
- may be a **question** (unresolved) or an **answer** (resolved)
- can sprout new **branches** outward

Each **branch**:

- grows **from one berry**
- fans out to **many other berries**
- encodes a **semantic motion** (a prompt for traversal)

## 🧠 recursive structure

This metaphor supports recursive semantic growth:

\`\`\`txt
🫐 fruit
   └─🌿 what are examples?
        ├─🫐 banana
        │     └─🌿 what are types?
        │          ├─🫐 cavendish
        │          └─🫐 plantain
        ├─🫐 apple
        └─🫐 mango
\`\`\`

- **Questions** (branches) link from one berry to many others
- Each **answer** berry may sprout more branches
- This forms a **recursive concept tree**, shaped by questions-as-links

## 🔁 semantic equivalence

| concept type     | metaphor   | system term | notes                         |
|------------------|------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| question         | 🌿 branch  | `question`  | fan-out prompt                |
| answer           | 🫐 berry   | `sumption`  | reachable concept             |
| question-as-node | 🫐 berry   | `sumption`  | all questions are also nodes |
| unresolved node  | 🫐 berry   | `sumption`  | may hold a question           |
| resolved node    | 🫐 berry   | `sumption`  | may be an answer              |

## 🧭 summary

> **Traversal = branches growing from berries**
> **Berries = sumptions = concepts**
> **Branches = questions = semantic links**

This metaphor:

- aligns with natural growth
- is recursive and composable
- keeps cognitive load minimal with just **2 primitives**
- reflects a **cauliflorous** conceptual model — where knowledge (berries) grows directly from trunk concepts

## 🔗 integrations

This metaphor supports:

- `.brief: concept.traversal.via.questions`
- `.brief: sumption`
- `cortal.focus` → focus moves between berries via branches
- `concept.gravity` → certain berries attract more branches
- `concept.perspectives` → define the berry you focus from

> 🫐 Every idea you hold is a berry.
> 🌿 Every question you ask grows a branch.
> 🌳 Thought is what happens as your branches explore the berry-forest.
