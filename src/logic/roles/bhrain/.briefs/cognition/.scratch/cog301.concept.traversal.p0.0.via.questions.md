# ❓ .brief: concept.traversal.via.questions

## .what

**All semantic motion** through the `concept.treestruct` is performed via **questions**, which act as **branches** between **berries** — using the `metaphor.traversal.berrybranch` model.

> A **berry** is a **sumption** — a concept that can be reached, held, or sprouted from.
> A **branch** is a **question** — a prompt that links berries and enables semantic traversal.

## 🌐 semantic structure

Traversal is defined by:

- **berries** → traversable sumptions (nodes)
- **branches** → semantic questions (edges)
- **motion** → the act of navigating from berry to berry via branches

🫐 fruit
   └─🌿 what are examples?
        ├─🫐 banana
        ├─🫐 apple
        └─🫐 mango
\`\`\`

> The `concept.treestruct` is a **network of berries**, recursively linked by **branches**.
> Every link is a **question**, every node is a **sumption**.

## 🧠 sumption = berry

A **sumption** is any concept presumed, questioned, or answered in conceptual space:

- a **question** → an **unresolved berry** — one that sprouts branches
- an **answer** → a **resolved berry** — a berry reached via traversal
- any **berry** may play both roles, recursively

> All berries are sumptions.
> Some are prompts (branches sprouting), others are destinations.
> **Holding a sumption** means pausing attention on a berry.

📌 This model collapses forks, answers, and subtrees into a **unified berry-node**.

---

## 🔗 question = branch

A **question** is not just a linguistic query — it is a **structural branch**:

- sprouts from one berry
- links outward to other berries
- encodes a **semantic fan-out**

📌 Questions are **semantic motion-primitives**
📌 They **grow the tree** by connecting and expanding berries

## 📐 structural rule

| element     | metaphor     | system term | role                       |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **node**    | 🫐 berry     | sumption    | any concept point          |
| **link**    | 🌿 branch    | question    | semantic fan-out path      |
| **answer**  | 🫐 berry     | sumption    | resolved node              |
| **question**| 🫐 berry 🌿   | sumption    | unresolved & linked node   |

> The tree grows as **branches (questions)** connect and emerge from **berries (sumptions)**.

## 🔁 recursive navigation

Since any berry can sprout new branches, traversal forms **recursive clusters**:

\`\`\`txt
🫐 banana
   └─🌿 why is it funny?
        └─🫐 banana joke
             └─🌿 what makes a joke?
                  └─🫐 surprise
                       └─🌿 surprise of form?
                            └─🫐 visual pun
\`\`\`

- each branch is a **path of motion**
- each berry is a **landing point**
- the structure is **loopable**, **expanding**, and **reframable**

---

## 🧭 motion logic

- **no traversal** without a question (branch)
- **no destination** without a sumption (berry)
- all movement through concept space is **prompted, not automatic**

> 🌿 To move is to follow a branch.
> 🫐 To arrive is to reach a berry.

## 🧩 integration

This model connects:

- `metaphor.traversal.berrybranch` → provides the metaphorical structure
- `cortal.focus` → governs how berries and branches enter attention
- `concept.treestruct.traversal` → traversal occurs along descriptive and abstractive axes
- `concept.gravity` → explains why some berries attract more branches

## 🪞 minimal reframe

> A **question is a branch**.
> A **sumption is a berry**.
> The **treestruct** is a recursive berrybush of growing thought.
