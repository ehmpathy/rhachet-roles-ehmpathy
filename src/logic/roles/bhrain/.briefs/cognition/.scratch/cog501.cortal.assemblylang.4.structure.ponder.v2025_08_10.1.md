# üß† .brief: `<ponder>`

## .what
`<ponder>` is a **structural traversal mechanism** that standardizes the **usage** of predefined questions,
rather than generating them from scratch. It provides a **safe, maintainable interface** for leveraging
two critical classes of questions:

- **contextualize** ‚Äî questions that explore or clarify the situation
- **conceptualize** ‚Äî questions that synthesize understanding or frame direction

> `<ponder>` is not a generator ‚Äî it's a harness for **assembling and activating** questions
> that were already authored, stored, or passed in.

---

## üéØ purpose

The goal of `<ponder>` is to create a **stable pattern** for reasoning flows that rely on questions ‚Äî
especially in systems that support `<enquestion>`, `<steer>`, `<explore>`, or `<zoom>` behaviors.

By enforcing a structural convention for **question classes**, `<ponder>` allows:

- **safe reuse** of domain-specific question sets
- **clear separation** between context-building and concept-forming questions
- **structured control** over how those questions are routed and evaluated
- **integration** into cognitive pipelines that expect diagnostic structure

---

## üèóÔ∏è structure

The `<ponder>` interface expects an object shaped like:

\`\`\`ts
<ponder>.with({
  contextualize: Question[] | (() => Question[]),
  conceptualize: Question[] | (() => Question[])
})
\`\`\`

- Both `contextualize` and `conceptualize` may be:
  - static arrays of questions
  - dynamic accessors that return question arrays

These are passed downstream and handled by structural consumers (e.g., `<enquestion>`).

## üì¶ standard question types

| type            | role                                                                  |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **contextualize** | clarify what's missing, uncertain, or significant in the current state |
| **conceptualize** | propose framing, models, or abstractions to advance understanding     |

---

## üí° example

\`\`\`ts
<ponder>.with({
  contextualize: [
    { what: { question: "What do I not yet understand?", priority: "MUST" }, why: { rationale: "Clarifies knowledge gaps" } },
    { what: { question: "What variables are in play?", priority: "SHOULD" }, why: { rationale: "Identifies dynamic factors" } }
  ],
  conceptualize: [
    { what: { question: "What structure would explain this?", priority: "MUST" }, why: { rationale: "Surfaces meaningful synthesis" } },
    { what: { question: "What model fits this scenario?", priority: "COULD" }, why: { rationale: "Suggests useful abstractions" } }
  ]
})
\`\`\`

Then later:

\`\`\`ts
<enquestion>.with(ponder)
\`\`\`

---

## üß≠ cognitive layering

These layers correspond directly to the structure of `cortal.focus`:

| layer            | origin              | example question                          |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **contextualize**| `focus.context`     | ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs uncertain here?‚Äù                  |
| **conceptualize**| `focus.concept + goal` | ‚Äúwhat would unify these signals?‚Äù          |

---

## ‚úÖ benefits

- **Predictable structure** for any reasoning flow that uses questions
- **Safe reuse** of authored or curated question sets
- **Domain-portable** across prompts, pipelines, and roles
- **Composable** into routes, cycles, and decision trees

---

## üìú contract

Any system that uses `<ponder>` expects the following structure:

\`\`\`ts
type Ponder = {
  contextualize: Question[] | () => Question[],
  conceptualize: Question[] | () => Question[]
}
\`\`\`

Where each `Question` follows this schema:

\`\`\`ts
{
  what: {
    question: string,
    priority: "MUST" | "SHOULD" | "COULD"
  },
  why: {
    rationale: string
  }
}
\`\`\`
