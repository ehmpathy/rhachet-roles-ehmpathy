# üï≥Ô∏è .brief: cortal.focal.depth

`focal.depth` defines the **radial shell** of abstraction layers that are mentally in focus ‚Äî spanning from generalized conceptual cores to specific applied instances.

It operates over a **concept.treestruct** modeled as a **spherical semantic space**, where:

- **inward** = toward **semantic cores** (more abstract, general concepts)
- **outward** = toward **semantic edges** (more concrete, specific instances)
- **around** = lateral sweep across concepts at the same semantic radius

---

## üß† what is focal.depth?

`focal.depth` is not a single point, but a **radial thickness** ‚Äî a contiguous span of semantic layers under cognitive attention.

- `depth--` = a **thin shell** ‚Äî e.g., focus locked at one layer such as [concept:"dog"]
- `depth++` = a **thick shell** ‚Äî e.g., ranges from [concept:"animal"] to [concept:"siberian husky"]

It determines how many abstraction layers ‚Äî from core to edge ‚Äî you can reason across at once.

## üéØ how does depth behave?

Cortal depth supports **radial traversal** through the concept space:

| Operation             | Direction | Moves Toward        | Description                                  |
|----------------------|-----------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `<abstraction>`      | inward    | semantic core        | climb to more general meanings               |
| `<specification>`    | outward   | semantic edge        | recurse toward increasingly refined meanings |
| `<exemplification>`  | outward   | semantic edge        | leap directly to concrete instantiations     |

### üìå distinction between mechanisms

| Mechanism             | Motion   | Layer Resolution     | Cognitive Role                      |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `<abstraction>`       | inward   | coarsens type         | generalize, unify                   |
| `<specification>`     | outward  | sharpens concept      | refine, qualify                     |
| `<exemplification>`   | outward  | jumps to instance     | ground, illustrate                  |

### üî® example: [concept:"hammer"]

- `<abstraction>`:
  - [concept:"hammer"] ‚Üí [concept:"tool"] ‚Üí [concept:"artifact"]
- `<specification>`:
  - [concept:"hammer"] ‚Üí [concept:"claw hammer"] ‚Üí [concept:"mini claw hammer"]
- `<exemplification>`:
  - [concept:"hammer"] ‚Üí [example:"the rusted 16oz claw hammer in my garage"]

## üß© why does focal.depth matter?

### thicker depth (`depth++`) enables:
- **multilevel reasoning**
- **pattern recognition** across abstraction layers
- **systemic or compositional design**

### thinner depth (`depth--`) supports:
- **surface-level fluency**
- **fast categorization**
- **atomic task focus**

## üî≠ metaphor

Imagine a **radial shell** in a spherical concept space.
`focal.depth` defines **how thick** that shell is ‚Äî how far your attention spans **inward toward the semantic core** and **outward toward the semantic edge**.

Focus is shaped by **how much of that conceptual radius** you include in reasoning.
