# 🧠 `.brief`: `<ponder>`

## 🧭 .what
`<ponder>` is a **structural traversal framework** for **composing semantic direction**
by assembling and activating **predefined questions**. It operates not by generating questions from scratch,
but by **structuring how existing questions are used** to refine a semantic focus.

It mutates both:

- `focus.context` (posture) → via `<contextualize>`
- `focus.concept` (position) → via `<conceptualize>`

> 🌀 *to ponder is to build a better direction of thought
> by composing meaningful questions that shape attention and movement.*

---

## 🎯 purpose

The goal of `<ponder>` is to enable **deliberate semantic traversal** —
refining *where* you're focusing and *how* you're interpreting —
through the reuse and orchestration of structured questions.

It is used in reasoning flows such as `<zoom>`, `<steer>`, or `<enquestion>`,
but remains agnostic to those consumers.

## 🏗️ structure

\`\`\`ts
<ponder>.with({
  contextualize: Question[] | () => Question[],
  conceptualize: Question[] | () => Question[]
})
=> {
  focus.context, // mutate posture
  focus.concept // mutate position
}
\`\`\`

- **contextualize**: populates `focus.context` with salience and relevance
- **conceptualize**: re-anchors `focus.concept` to a more effective semantic berry
- both may be:
  - static arrays of questions
  - functions that return such arrays

---

## 🧩 internal subgoals

### 1. `<contextualize>` — mutate posture
> clarify what matters, what’s missing, and what’s assumed
→ mutates `focus.context`

---

### 2. `<conceptualize>` — mutate position
> shift attention to a new semantic anchor
→ mutates `focus.concept`

---

## 🧠 cognitive layering

Each subgoal corresponds to a distinct layer of `cortal.focus`:

| layer            | target            | example question                          |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **contextualize**| `focus.context`   | “what’s uncertain here?”                  |
| **conceptualize**| `focus.concept`   | “what concept would unify these inputs?”  |

---

## 📦 standard question format

Each question used in `<ponder>` should follow this contract:

\`\`\`ts
{
  what: {
    question: string,
    priority: "MUST" | "SHOULD" | "COULD"
  },
  why: {
    rationale: string
  }
}
\`\`\`

## 💡 example

\`\`\`ts
<ponder>.with({
  contextualize: [
    { what: { question: "What do I not yet understand?", priority: "MUST" }, why: { rationale: "Clarifies knowledge gaps" } },
    { what: { question: "What variables are in play?", priority: "SHOULD" }, why: { rationale: "Identifies dynamic factors" } }
  ],
  conceptualize: [
    { what: { question: "What structure would explain this?", priority: "MUST" }, why: { rationale: "Surfaces meaningful synthesis" } },
    { what: { question: "What model fits this scenario?", priority: "COULD" }, why: { rationale: "Suggests useful abstractions" } }
  ]
})
\`\`\`

## 🔁 variants

| form            | description                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **oneshot**       | posture and position refined in one unified pass         |
| **multistep**     | each subgoal run separately, allowing intermediate input |
| **interactive**   | human- or agent-guided pondering                         |
| **recursive**     | `<conceptualize>` may invoke nested `<ponder>` flows     |

---

## ✅ benefits

- **Safe reuse** of authored or curated question sets
- **Structured semantic mutation** of posture and position
- **Domain-portable** across prompts, agents, and roles
- **Composable** into routes, cycles, and diagnostic trees
- **Predictable schema** for reasoning systems that rely on question structure
