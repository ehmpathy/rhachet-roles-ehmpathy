# .brief: cortal.focus

## what

**cortal.focus** models the tradeoffs involved in **conceptual focus** — how the mind allocates cognitive resources during reasoning, perception, and problem-solving.

It parallels optical focus by defining four interacting dimensions:

- **cortal.acuity** — how sharply defined in fineness of detail a concept is
- **cortal.breadth** — how much surrounding context or associative material is considered
- **cortal.depth** — how far reasoning reaches below or around a focal concept (implications, sublayers)
- **cortal.distance** — how far the subject is from the thinker’s own frame of reference (abstraction, unfamiliarity)

---

## key constraint

\`\`\`
cortal.acuity² × cortal.depth ∝ cortal.distance² × cortal.breadth²
\`\`\`

This mirrors the optical tradeoff:

- You cannot increase **acuity**, **depth**, **breadth**, and **distance** all at once.
- Gaining in one area demands tradeoffs in another.

## mapped concepts

| Variable           | Cognitive Meaning                                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **cortal.acuity**   | How crisp or differentiated your concept model is              |
| **cortal.breadth**  | How wide your mental scope is — how many related factors, fields, or perspectives you're tracking |
| **cortal.depth**    | How far your thought reaches — substructures, consequences, assumptions |
| **cortal.distance** | How familiar or abstract the concept is from your lived experience |

## usage modes

| Goal                 | Increase this…      | At cost of…                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Precision            | **cortal.acuity** ↑   | Reduce **breadth** or **distance**            |
| Big-picture framing  | **cortal.breadth** ↑  | Accept lower **acuity** and **depth**         |
| Abstraction/generalization | **cortal.distance** ↑ | Accept lower **acuity** or **depth**         |
| Deep reasoning       | **cortal.depth** ↑    | Reduce **breadth** and stay close (↓distance) |

## examples

- Want **finer conceptual distinctions**? (cortal.acuity++)
  - Narrow your context (cortal.breadth--)
  - Stay grounded in the familiar (cortal.distance--)

- Want **wider perspective**? (cortal.breadth++)
  - Tolerate vagueness (cortal.acuity--)
  - Reduce inference depth (cortal.depth--)

- Want to **generalize across domains**? (cortal.distance++)
  - Use broader categories (cortal.acuity--)
  - Accept shallower penetration (cortal.depth--)

- Want to **reason deeply**? (cortal.depth++)
  - Reduce distractions (cortal.breadth--)
  - Stay closer to what you already know (cortal.distance--)

## metaphor

> **cortal.focus** is a cognitive lens.
> The more you widen your view or step into abstraction, the more your clarity must soften.
> Precision lives in the narrow and near; wisdom arises from mastering the tradeoff.
