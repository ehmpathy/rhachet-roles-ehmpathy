# 🧠 `.brief`: `<ponder>`

## 🧭 what it is
`<ponder>` **applies questions to refocus your focus**.
it runs through a set of questions to **tune your stance** (*focus.context*) and **lock in your target** (*focus.concept*) **before you put that focus to work**.

it doesn’t make up new questions — it **uses ones you already trust**, arranging them in an order that sharpens your aim and gets your head in the right spot before the real work starts.

> 🌀 *to ponder is to line up the right questions so your next move hits where it should.*

## 🎯 why you’d use it
- makes sure you’re looking at the right stuff
- gets rid of blind spots before acting
- works in any trade or field

---

## 🏗️ how it works
\`\`\`ts
<ponder>.with({
  contextualize: Question[] | () => Question[],
  conceptualize: Question[] | () => Question[]
})
=> {
  focus.context, // stance
  focus.concept  // target
}
\`\`\`
- **contextualize** → questions to adjust your stance (what you see, what you’re missing)
- **conceptualize** → questions to re-aim your target (what you’re going after)
- both can be static lists or functions that return lists

---

## 🧩 the two steps

1. **`<contextualize>`** — tune your stance
   → “what matters here?” “what’s unclear?” “what am i assuming?”

2. **`<conceptualize>`** — lock in your target
   → “what’s the main thing?” “what unites the pieces?” “what model fits best?”

## 📦 question format
\`\`\`ts
{
  what: { question: string, priority: "MUST" | "SHOULD" | "COULD" },
  why:  { rationale: string }
}
\`\`\`

---

## 💡 example
\`\`\`ts
<ponder>.with({
  contextualize: [
    { what: { question: "what don’t i understand yet?", priority: "MUST" }, why: { rationale: "find gaps" } }
  ],
  conceptualize: [
    { what: { question: "what ties this together?", priority: "MUST" }, why: { rationale: "make sense of it" } }
  ]
})
\`\`\`

## ✅ why it works
- refocuses before action
- sharpens both stance and target
- predictable, reusable, and portable
