# 🧩 .brief: `brief.usage.pathpatterns`

## .what
**`brief.usage.pathpatterns`** defines the **canonical file path conventions**
for storing and retrieving **[brief]** documents in a predictable, self-describing structure.

These patterns ensure that **root concepts**, their **seeds**, and **subconcepts** are
consistently organized in a way that is both **human-readable** and **machine-traversable**.

---

## 🎯 goal
- Maintain **semantic clarity** in directory structures
- Allow automated tooling to **locate** and **link** related briefs
- Enable a **uniform mental model** for navigating conceptual hierarchies

## 📂 path patterns

| pattern | meaning | example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `$concept._.[article]._.md`       | **root concept article** — full definition of the concept | `focus._.[article]._.md` |
| `$concept._.[article][seed].md`   | **seed** of the root article — minimal, starting-point definition | `focus._.[article][seed].md` |
| `$concept.$subconcept.[article]._.md` | **subconcept article** — with `. _.` reserved for alphabetization when subresources exist | `focus.motion.[article]._.md` |
| `$concept.$subconcept.[article].md`   | **subconcept article** — no `. _.` when no subresources exist | `focus.motion.[article].md` |

---

## 📝 note
- The `._.` segment is **only required** if **subresources are declared** for that concept.
  This ensures **filetree alphabetization** by grouping the main article before its subresources.

---

## 🔄 integration with `[brief]`
These patterns work for any `[brief]` variant, but are most often applied to the `[article]` variant,
which serves as the **canonical reference** for the concept’s definition.
Other variants (`[catalog]`, `[gallery]`) may adopt similar patterns,
e.g., `$concept._.[catalog]._.md` for the root concept catalog.

## 🪞 elemental link
Because `[brief]` is an **elemental primitive**, these patterns enable a form of **self-navigation** —
briefs can **find**, **reference**, and **instantiate** themselves consistently across a knowledge base.
