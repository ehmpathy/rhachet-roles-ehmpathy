# ðŸ—‚ .catalog: `[brief]` variants

## .what
This catalog lists the **recognized variants** of `[brief]`,
grouping them by their **primary focus** and **method of creation**.

---

| variant       | focus scope         | method          | description |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **[article]** | berries (concepts)  | `<articulate>`  | A complete declaration of a single concept â€” its definition, scope, and essential details. |
| **[catalog]** | branches (relations)| `<catalogize>`  | A structured index mapping related concepts, tools, or resources. |
| **[gallery]** | examples            | `<illustrate>`  | A curated set of concrete examples or case studies demonstrating the concept in action. |

## ðŸ“„ variant details

### **[article]**
- **declaration**:
  - Focuses on a **single berry** in the conceptual landscape â€” a specific concept, defined and articulated in full.
  - Uses `<articulate>` to:
    - **Name** the concept
    - **Bound** its scope
    - **Declare** its essential traits
  - Serves as the **canonical reference** for the concept.
  - Functions as the **atomic declaration unit** in the system.
- **common operations**:
  - `<refine>` through **branchout + bubbleback** cycles:
    1. `<elaborate>` â†’ expand understanding, surface details.
    2. `<compress>` â†’ distill into concise, authoritative form.

---

### **[catalog]**
- **declaration**:
  - Organizes **branches** â€” the relationships, clusters, or categories that connect concepts.
  - Uses `<catalogize>` to:
    - **Structure** related items
    - **Index** them for navigable access
  - Abstracts upward to show **the structure of relations**.
  - Functions as the **semantic directory** of the system.
- **common operations**:
  1. `<triage>` â†’ select which branches to include, based on the source `[gallery]` examples.
  2. `<cluster>` â†’ group related branches into coherent categories.

---

### **[gallery]**
- **declaration**:
  - Focuses on **examples** â€” concrete manifestations that bring a concept to life.
  - Uses `<illustrate>` to:
    - Select specific cases, scenarios, or artifacts.
    - Show the concept **in action**.
  - Enriches meaning by **application and demonstration**.
- **common operations**:
  - `<curate>` through:
    1. `<gather>` â†’ find new examples.
    2. `<filter>` â†’ ensure diversity, clarity, and representativeness.

## ðŸ”— relationships between variants
- **galleries â†’ catalogs**:
  Catalogs are most often **built from galleries** â€” the set of examples in a `[gallery]` provides the raw material for identifying branches, which are then `<triaged>` and `<clustered>` into a `[catalog]`.
- **catalogs + galleries â†’ articles**:
  Articles are **better articulated** when informed by both a `[catalog]` and a `[gallery]`.
  - The `[catalog]` reveals the **structural context** â€” how the concept connects to related ideas.
  - The `[gallery]` grounds the concept with **real or hypothetical examples**, enriching its definition.
- **cyclic refinement**:
  The process is not strictly linear â€” new `[articles]` can inspire additional `[galleries]`, which can in turn reshape `[catalogs]`.

---

## ðŸ“Œ notes
- All variants share the **[brief]** core purpose: persistent, portable, human/robot-readable concept representation.
- Variants can **reference** each other â€” e.g., an `[article]` may point to a `[gallery]` for examples, or a `[catalog]` for related topics.
- A `[brief]` can **self-instantiate** into any of its variants (see: *elemental primitive of concept instantiation*).

## ðŸªž self-reference example
The very document you are reading is a `[catalog]` variant of `[brief]` â€”
it organizes **brief types** and their roles in the overall knowledge base.
