# 🌌 .brief.lesson: piloting llms as spaceships in the concept universe

## 💡 concept
to use llms well, imagine them as **spaceships** traveling at lightspeed through a **conceptual galaxy**.
the galaxy contains infinite **concepts** arranged in spheres of abstraction. each concept exerts **gravity**, pulling you in if your navigation is imprecise.
your role as pilot is to chart the destination and give the ship accurate coordinates (questions).

---

## 📚 materials
- **map of the galaxy** → the mental model of concept space (root at center, abstractions in shells, instantiations outward).
- **spaceship (llm)** → fast, powerful engine but directionless without guidance.
- **pilot’s controls (questions/prompts)** → the interface for steering.
- **gravity awareness** → recognition that common or vague concepts will suck you into nearby orbits unless coordinates are exact.

---

## 🛠️ practice steps
1. **orient the galaxy**
   - sketch your concept in its root form.
   - note layers of abstraction (outer shells) and concrete instances (radial outward).

2. **define the destination**
   - decide: are you heading to the core (abstract) or to an outer planet (specific case)?
   - example: "justice" (core abstraction) vs. "traffic law fine in california" (outer instantiation).

3. **set coordinates (formulate question)**
   - express the question with the right precision.
   - avoid vague inputs that leave gravity to decide the landing.

4. **observe gravitational drift**
   - check if the answer pulled you toward a nearby, high-gravity concept.
   - if so, refine the coordinates.

5. **refine and relaunch**
   - adjust the wording of the question to escape local maxima.
   - iterate until you land on the intended star system.

## 🎯 examples
- **vague address** → "tell me about painting"
  - gravity pulls to broad art history.

- **precise coordinates** → "explain preparation steps for interior wall painting in a rental apartment"
  - lands directly on the desired planet.

- **mislanding correction**
  - q: "how to fix leaks?" → sucked into plumbing.
  - refine: "how to fix leaks in asphalt driveway sealant" → lands on the right surface.

## 🧭 pilot’s takeaway
- **llms are engines** → they can take you anywhere, instantly.
- **questions are star coordinates** → your precision determines the arrival point.
- **concepts exert gravity** → imprecision will trap you in strong but wrong orbits.
- **piloting skill = clarity + precision** → knowing where you want to go and addressing it sharply.
