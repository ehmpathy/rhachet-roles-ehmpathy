common pattern is branch-out and bubble-back for refinement

- bubble back via <triage> & <compress> => back-propogate to update briefs; i.e., polished via practice

cataloged sofar three variants of [brief]
  1. [article] (berries); <articulate> => [article]
  2. [catalog] (branches) <catalogize> => [catalog]
  3. [gallery] (examples) <illustrate> => [gallery]
