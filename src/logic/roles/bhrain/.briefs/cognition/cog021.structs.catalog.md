# üóÇÔ∏è .brief: `catalog`

## .what
A **catalog** is a **structured concept collection**, where each item is
paired with **descriptive information** to support **recognition**, **selection**, or **retrieval**.

It serves as a **semantic surface** over a deeper collection ‚Äî
organized for **browsing**, **filtering**, and **comparative reasoning**.

While an **inventory** tracks availability or logistics,
a catalog emphasizes **clarity, presentation, and user-centered discovery**.

## üß≠ key traits

| trait             | meaning                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **enumerated**     | each concept is explicitly listed, not abstracted away                 |
| **descriptive**    | highlights distinguishing features (e.g. label, image, type, metadata) |
| **browsable**      | optimized for lateral focus and scanning across entries                |
| **non-exhaustive** | curated based on salience, criteria, or constraints                    |
| **ordered**        | often sorted semantically or pragmatically (e.g. relevance, recency)   |

## üß© comparison

| structure    | emphasizes                 | typical use                        |
|--------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `index`      | position or reference       | lookup or navigation               |
| `inventory`  | quantity and availability   | logistics, restocking, tracking    |
| `catalog`    | structure and presentation  | curation, exploration, shopping    |

## üì¶ examples

- a **product catalog** listing items by type, brand, and price
- a **library catalog** with subject tags, authors, and summaries
- a **course catalog** organizing classes with time, credits, and prerequisites

## üß† role in semantic systems

In a `concept.treestruct`, a catalog acts as a **flattened radial slice**
at a given `focal.depth` ‚Äî exposing **breadth peers** for comparison or selection.

It is often used in tandem with primitives like `<compare>`, `<cluster>`, or `<instantiate>`
to surface patterns or choose options from a structured field.
