## 🧪 .examples: `questions.composite.smooth`

Each example begins with **primitive rough questions**,
then shows how **compositional refinement** leads to a smooth, precise query.

### 📍 Example 1 — temporal cause

**Rough primitives:**
- "why?"
- "when?"
- "what?"

\`\`\`ts
→ "why?"
→ "why did it happen?"
→ "why did it happen when it did?"
→ "what triggered the event X at time Y?"
\`\`\`

> 📦 combines `breadth.causal++` + `breadth.temporal++` + `depth.instantiate`

### 🛠️ Example 2 — actor and method

**Rough primitives:**
- "who?"
- "how?"
- "what?"

\`\`\`ts
→ "who made this?"
→ "how did they make it?"
→ "what method did person Z use to produce item Y?"
\`\`\`

> 📦 combines `breadth.subjective++` + `acuity.substructs++` + `breadth.functional++`

---

### 🧭 Example 3 — location and identity

**Rough primitives:**
- "what?"
- "where?"

\`\`\`ts
→ "what is it?"
→ "what is it doing here?"
→ "why is this object located in this place?"
\`\`\`

> 📦 combines `acuity.attributes++` + `breadth.spatial++` + `breadth.causal++`

---

### 🧪 Example 4 — hypothetical reasoning

**Rough primitives:**
- "what?"
- "what if...?"
- "how?"

\`\`\`ts
→ "what if we changed X?"
→ "what would happen if we changed X?"
→ "how would changing X affect outcome Y?"
\`\`\`

> 📦 combines `breadth.categorical++` + `depth.instantiate` + `breadth.functional++`

---

### 🧰 Example 5 — value and decision

**Rough primitives:**
- "what?"
- "which?"
- "what matters?"

\`\`\`ts
→ "what are the options?"
→ "which option matters most?"
→ "what decision is best given criteria Z?"
\`\`\`

> 📦 combines `breadth.categorical++` + `acuity.attributes++` + salience reasoning

## 🪄 pattern

> Each smooth question acts as a **semantic vector shortcut**
> — a compressed form of its constituent interrogative path.
