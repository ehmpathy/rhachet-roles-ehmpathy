# 🌐 .brief: concept.treestruct.universal

## .what
The **universal perspective** views concept space as a single, infinite **RootStruct** — the **concept rootball** — where all concepts are nodes radiating outward from a single absolute core: `"concept"`.

This frame treats concepts as having **absolute positions** in a shared structure. Motion is described using **spherical traversal**, not relative zoom.

---

## .why
This perspective provides:

- an objective map of the semantic universe
- a consistent reference for abstraction, specialization, and analogy
- a substrate for intersecting TreeStructs to safely coexist
- a gravitational pull toward core ideas like `"concept"`, `"thing"`, or `"entity"`

---

## .structure

The concept rootball is modeled as an **infinite spherical structure**:

- **radial axis** = abstraction level
  - inward = more abstract
  - outward = more specific
- **lateral plane** = peers at the same level of abstraction
- **angular displacement** = movement across semantic axes or domains

Each concept node is positioned by:
- `focal.depth` → how far it is from the core
- `focal.breadth` → how wide its local context is (peer connections)
- `focal.acuity` → how precisely it is resolved at that layer

---

## .traversal

All movement is defined by spherical geometry:

- **radial**: toward the core (abstraction) or away from it (specialization)
- **lateral**: across sibling nodes at the same depth (e.g., `"dog"` ↔ `"cat"`)
- **angular**: between different axes or domains (e.g., `"knife"` ↔ `"word"`)

> When angular displacements are small, **lateral ≈ angular**.
> When crossing domains or axes, **angular motion becomes distinct**, often involving metaphor or re-framing.

---

## .examples

- `"dog"` → `"mammal"` → `"animal"` → `"organism"` → `"concept"`
  → radial inward (abstraction)

- `"dog"` → `"herding dog"` → `"border collie"` → `"tri-colored border collie"`
  → radial outward (specialization)

- `"dog"` ↔ `"cat"` ↔ `"rabbit"`
  → lateral traversal

- `"dog"` ↔ `"companion"` ↔ `"servant"` ↔ `"vehicle"`
  → angular traversal across roles and metaphors

---

## .core

The root of the universal TreeStruct is the concept: `"concept"`.

All conceptual paths — regardless of starting point or traversal method — ultimately collapse inward toward this root via abstraction.

> The rootball is not a hierarchy — it's a multi-branching **semantic continuum**, with a gravitational center of meaning.

---

## .notes

- This perspective is **agnostic to the thinker** — it describes the structure itself, not how it is navigated
- It enables semantic alignment across domains via shared radial reference
- All relative and lens-based perspectives operate **within** this structure

> This is not how we think — it is **where** we think.
