# 🧩 .brief: `motion.why`

## .what
**`motion.why`** is the **traversal motion** of asking *“why”*.
it is a semantic vector that seeks explanation, pulling thought beyond *what is* toward *what underlies*.
this motion unfolds across **two fundamental axes**:

- **causal** — tracing **cause → effect**
- **rationale** — structuring **given → then**

---

## 🎯 goal
- uncover both the **mechanics** of events and the **logic** of reasoning
- link phenomena to their **causal chains** and **argument structures**
- equip reasoning with **factual clarity** (causal) and **logical clarity** (rationale)

## 📐 axes of motion

### 1. **causal axis**
**orientation**: retrospective, backward-seeking — from observed effect to its antecedent cause.

| slot     | description | example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **.cause** | the antecedent condition or trigger | the belt snapped |
| **.effect** | the resulting outcome observed | the machine stopped |

**causal traversal:** “why did the machine stop?” →
- .cause = belt snapped
- .effect = machine stopped

---

### 2. **rationale axis**
**orientation**: prospective, logical — from premises given to conclusions drawn.

| slot     | description | example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **.given** | the stated premise, reason, or assumption | all machines must pass safety checks |
| **.then** | the **claimed conclusion** that follows | therefore, we run maintenance checks |

**rationale traversal:** “why do we run maintenance checks?” →
- .given = all machines must pass safety checks
- .then = therefore, we run maintenance checks

---

## 🔑 notes
- **causal** = mechanical sequence: **.cause → .effect**
- **rationale** = logical sequence: **.given → .then**
- together, they span both:
  - **factual clarity** (what caused what)
  - **logical clarity** (what follows from what)
