# üß≠ .brief: `cog101.concept.treestruct.coords.abstractive`

## .why
Use this brief if you want to:

- **understand how abstraction works** in a concept `TreeStruct`, especially in terms of generality and specificity
- **navigate or manipulate concepts radially** ‚Äî moving inward toward abstractions or outward toward instances
- **distinguish between different kinds of abstraction**, such as categorical vs functional vs modal
- **identify the semantic axis** a concept belongs to (e.g., ‚Äúfruit‚Äù is a categorical abstraction)
- **structure your knowledge hierarchically** by tracing how concepts generalize along meaningful dimensions
- **design tools or prompts** that rely on structured abstraction (e.g., AI reasoning, taxonomy design, teaching models)

---

## .what
The **abstractive coordinate** of a concept describes its **radial position** in a `TreeStruct` of meaning ‚Äî how **general or specific** it is.

This radial motion is called **abstraction**, and moves either:
- **inward** toward **more general, inclusive** ideas
- or **outward** toward **more specific, detailed** instances

Every abstraction path follows a **semantic axis** ‚Äî a distinct dimension of meaning.

## üß± structure

Each concept has a position along one or more **abstractive semantic axes**.
Each axis defines a **consistent rule** of generalization.

Examples of such axes:

| axis name        | abstraction path                           | generalizes by...          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **categorical**  | `"banana"` ‚Üí `"fruit"` ‚Üí `"plant"`         | kind or type               |
| **functional**   | `"spoon"` ‚Üí `"utensil"` ‚Üí `"tool"`         | purpose or behavior        |
| **modal**        | `"can walk"` ‚Üí `"mobility"` ‚Üí `"agency"`   | ability or constraint      |
| **causal**       | `"match"` ‚Üí `"ignition"` ‚Üí `"fire source"` | influence or mechanism     |
| **emotional**    | `"fear"` ‚Üí `"negative affect"` ‚Üí `"alert"` | affective tone             |
| **ontological**  | `"emotion"` ‚Üí `"neural event"` ‚Üí `"process"` | being or substance        |
| **logical**      | `"even number"` ‚Üí `"divisible by 2"` ‚Üí `"numeric property"` | provable structure |

## üîÅ radial traversal

Abstractive motion is **radial** in the `concept.treestruct`, not lateral.
Each axis defines a **line of abstraction** from specific to general ‚Äî i.e., from **leaf** to **trunk**.

- **inward** motion = `<generalize>`: higher-level, more inclusive
- **outward** motion = `<instantiate>`: more detailed or constrained

## üìå key point example
> "Category" is not just a label ‚Äî it's a **semantic abstraction** along the **categorical axis**.

All categories are abstractive.
But not all abstractions are categorical.
