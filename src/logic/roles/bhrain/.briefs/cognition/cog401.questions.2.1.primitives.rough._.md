# 🧩 .brief: `questions.primitive.rough`

## .what

**Core primitive questions** are the most basic forms of inquiry —
deep, language-universal prompts that initiate motion along a **rough semantic vector**.

Each one points toward a major axis of thought (e.g. cause, time, actor)
without specifying directionality or precision.
They are **composable** — refined over time to form smooth, structured questions.

> 🧠 think of them as **semantic compass taps** —
> minimal cues that orient thought, not define its route.

## 🧭 properties of primitive rough questions

| trait                | value                                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **underspecified**   | lacks constraints, context-sensitive                  |
| **dimensional**      | maps to a core semantic axis                         |
| **refinable**        | can be composed into smooth multi-axis questions      |
| **ubiquitous**       | appears in nearly all reasoning chains                |

## 🔁 example: question refinement chain

\`\`\`ts
// start rough
"why?"

→ refine:
"why did it happen?"

→ compose:
"why did it happen now?"

→ smooth:
"what causal mechanism triggered the change in X at time Y?"
\`\`\`

Each stage increases:
- dimensional specificity
- semantic alignment
- likelihood of landing directly on the answer

## 🪞 metaphor

> primitive rough questions are like **bare intentions**:
> they point, not plot.
>
> a **rough question** is a starting spark —
> a **smooth question** is a guided strike.

## 🧠 relationship to `interrogative.primitives`

This catalog is grounded in the theory of **semantic primes** (from NSM),
which proposes that all human languages share a small set of **universal concepts**
used to express questions. These deep forms remain consistent
even when surface syntax differs.

Primitive rough questions are:
- **linguistically universal** (e.g. *who*, *what*, *why*, etc.)
- **semantically foundational** (each targets a distinct axis of thought)
- **structurally minimal** (they can stand alone, or be composed)

---

## 🎯 use when you want to:

- seed structured thought with minimal scaffolding
- model the **first-hop motion** in a reasoning chain
- teach how composition sharpens semantic precision
- map natural language queries to motion primitives
- reconstruct the deep structure beneath question forms
