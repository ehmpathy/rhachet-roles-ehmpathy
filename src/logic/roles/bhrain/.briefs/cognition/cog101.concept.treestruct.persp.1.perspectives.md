# 🧭 .brief: concept.treestruct.perspectives

## .what
The **concept.treestruct.perspectives** brief defines the **three major ways** of understanding and navigating the concept rootball:

1. **universal perspective** — describes the objective structure of concept space
2. **relative perspective** — models the thinker’s navigation from a focal anchor
3. **fractal perspective** — reveals the self-similar, intersective, and recursive nature of meaning

Each perspective emphasizes a different axis of reasoning, but all operate within the same **RootStruct** — the infinite radial space rooted at `"concept"`.

---

## .why

This framing allows us to:

- switch between **absolute location**, **subjective movement**, and **compositional complexity**
- unify reasoning strategies under one structural system
- explain paradoxes of abstraction, categorization, and analogy
- design flexible semantic systems that honor both structure and interpretation

## .perspectives

### 🌐 universal perspective
> The concept rootball as a **fixed semantic structure**

- concepts are **absolute positions** in radial space
- movement uses **spherical traversal**:
  - `radial`: abstraction (in), specialization (out)
  - `lateral`: sibling concepts at same depth
  - `angular`: axis/domain/frame changes
- rooted at `"concept"` — all paths converge there

📌 no zoom — only position and displacement
📌 useful for structural modeling, hierarchy resolution, and axis alignment

---

### 🧭 relative perspective
> The concept rootball as **experienced from a focal anchor**

- movement defined by **zoom metaphors**:
  - `<zoomin>`: dive into attributes / internal structure
  - `<zoomout>`: broaden through context / external relations
- traversal mechanisms:
  - `via(attributes)`
  - `via(neighbors)`
- abstraction and specification can happen in either direction
- zoom direction is contextual — not absolute

📌 useful for thought modeling, analogy, and semantic exploration
📌 the “user interface” for navigating the universal structure

---

### 🧬 fractal perspective
> The concept rootball as a **recursive tangle of intersecting TreeStructs**

- concepts belong to **many overlapping hierarchies**
- each dimension (taxonomy, function, color, culture, etc.) forms a **partial tree**
- concepts are **shared nodes** — crosspoints between branches
- supports nested reasoning, lens composition, and local-rooted trees

📌 useful for modeling polycategorical meaning, domain lenses, and recursive re-framing
📌 generalizes the lens and domain models into a single recursive substrate

## .summary

| perspective | structure       | motion language     | focus             | root concept |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| universal   | absolute radial mesh | radial / lateral / angular | global semantics  | `"concept"` |
| relative    | zoom-centric view    | `<zoomin>` / `<zoomout>`     | local navigation  | user-defined |
| fractal     | recursive mesh       | recursive TreeStructs        | intersective roles | multiple |

---

## .notes

- all three perspectives are **valid**, and **mutually compatible**
- each reveals a different **facet of meaning**
- together, they support a complete model of **conceptual structure**, **thinking motion**, and **domain intersection**

> Concept space is not flat — it has **structure**, **anchor**, and **recursion**.
