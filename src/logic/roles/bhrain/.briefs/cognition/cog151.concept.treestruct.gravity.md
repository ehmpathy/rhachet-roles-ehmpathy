# ðŸŒŒ .brief: concept.gravity

## .what
**Concept.gravity** describes how certain concepts exert a **semantic pull**, functioning like **gravitational centers** in the conceptual rootball.

These high-gravity concepts act as **anchors for thought**, **starting points for exploration**, or **recurring nodes** that structure how we navigate, remember, and relate ideas.

---

## .why

This model explains:

- why certain concepts are **easier to recall** and return to
- why traversal often bends toward **familiar or salient ideas**
- how **working memory** orients around **persistent anchors**
- why some ideas feel "**central**" while others feel "**orbiting**" or **peripheral**

Concept.gravity offers a cognitive and navigational metaphor for the **structure of attention and recall**.

## .properties of gravity

- gravity â‰ˆ **semantic salience**
- higher-gravity concepts:
  - are more **memorable**, **central**, or **frequently visited**
  - act as **attractors** during traversal
  - may act as **default lenses** when exploring unknown space

- lower-gravity concepts:
  - require **conscious effort to locate or stabilize**
  - may be skipped over unless actively sought
  - often exist in the **shadow** of nearby cores

---

## .examples

- `"dog"` has high gravity in most minds â€” it's concrete, visual, familiar
- `"justice"` has abstract gravity â€” anchoring philosophical clusters
- `"fruit"` may act as a gravitational lens when exploring `"banana"`, `"apple"`, etc.
- `"concept"` itself is the universal core â€” the **black hole** at the center of all abstraction

## .gravitational traversal

> Traversal in the rootball is not always linear â€” it bends toward **nearby gravity wells**.

- when searching, thought often **snaps to the nearest core**
- if exploring `"knife"`, we might default to `"tool"` or `"weapon"` because of gravitational pull
- angular or exploratory moves are often **redirected or slowed** by nearby attractors

This explains why:
- **analogies drift toward known metaphors**
- **reframing** requires effort â€” escaping a gravitational frame
- **local gravity** defines whatâ€™s visible in working memory at a time

---

## .thought as traversal

> Thinking can be modeled as **traversal across gravitational fields of concepts**.

- high-gravity concepts act as **navigation hubs**
- thought often **orbits** or **spirals inward** around a central idea
- active thought involves **hopping between cores** while holding some in working memory
- expanding attention requires **venturing past the current pull**, sometimes using angular motion

---

## .working memory & orbiting

- concepts in **working memory** form a **local constellation**
- one acts as a **primary anchor** â€” the active lens
- others **orbit** as nearby or queued concepts
- **loss of anchor** can cause drift or re-centering

---

## .notes

- gravity is **relative** â€” depends on thinker, context, and task
- gravity can shift over time â€” reinforced concepts gain pull
- systems can intentionally **bias gravity** (e.g., prompts, education, interfaces)

> High-gravity concepts organize your thoughtspace.
> Low-gravity ones wait to be discovered â€” or pulled in.
