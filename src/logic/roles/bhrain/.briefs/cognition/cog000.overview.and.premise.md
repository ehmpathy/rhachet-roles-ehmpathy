# ðŸ§  .brief: `cortal.thoughtspace.foundation`

## .what = instantiate

This system instantiates a structured **thoughtspace**, where `focus` operates within a semantic `concept.treestruct` using navigable `motion` primitives.

---

### 1. `concept.treestruct` exists

- a semantic graph of concepts (nodes) and relationships (edges)
- structured as a **spherical tree**:
  - **radial axis** â†’ abstraction (general â†” specific)
  - **angular axes** â†’ descriptive variation (peers, types, traits)
- each concept has:
  - an **abstractive position** (radial)
  - a **descriptive position** (angular)

---

### 2. `focus` exists within the concept.treestruct

- defines a **perspective** â€” a relative point-of-view from which thought is applied
- composed of:

#### â–¸ **position**
- the specific **concept** from which the perspective is based
- the anchor for semantic navigation
- defined by its coordinates within the treestruct

#### â–¸ **posture**
- the **shape of attention**, or how the concept is being examined
- expressed across three internal dimensions:

  - `.depth` â†’ the **thickness of abstractive span** â€” how far focus reaches:
    - **inward** along the **radial axis** toward generalizations (`.depth.abstract++`)
    - **outward** along the **radial axis** toward concrete instances (`.depth.concrete++`)
    - both may expand **simultaneously**, forming a radial shell of multiple abstraction layers around the focal concept

  - `.breadth` â†’ the **spread across angular variation** â€” how many neighboring concepts at the same abstraction level are included
    - defined by motion along one or more **descriptive axes** (e.g. flavor, function, tone)
    - governs lateral comparisons, analogies, and contrasts

  - `.acuity` â†’ the **sharpness of resolution** at the current coordinate
    - `.attributes` â€” surface clarity: how precisely external traits are perceived
    - `.substructs` â€” internal clarity: how clearly nested parts or subcomponents are resolved

> posture defines how much **radial**, **angular**, and **granular** semantic material is held in focus â€”
> like shaping a lens through abstraction, variation, and precision.


---

### 3. motion is performed via **questions**, which act as **links**

- motion = semantic traversal through the `concept.treestruct`
- **questions** serve as the **edges** â€” the only valid drivers of motion
- **sumptions** serve as the **nodes** â€” semantic forks where focus can anchor

#### â–¸ sumption: the unified node type

A **sumption** is any semantic unit presumed or accepted for any reason â€” including:

- a **question** â†’ an **executable motion** â€” a prompt that enables semantic traversal
- an **answer** â†’ a **destination of a question** â€” one of the resolved outcomes of semantic traversal

> Any **answer** can itself be **any type of sumption** â€” including another **question**.
> This enables **recursive motion**, where questions resolve into deeper prompts,
> forming chains, trees, or loops of semantic navigation.

note: questions are not separate from the treestruct â€” they are **subtrees that encode traversability**.


#### â–¸ structural rule:

| element   | type         | role in treestruct             |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| **link**  | question     | enables motion (edge)          |
| **fork**  | sumption     | anchoring concept (node)       |
|           | â¤· question   | unresolved fork                |
|           | â¤· answer     | resolved fork                  |

> sumptions are **not truth-claims**, but **semantic constructs** that hold position in conceptual space.

### 4. exists `focus.motion.primitives`

- atomic, directional transformations of `focus.posture`
- each:
  - operates on a **single subaxis**
  - is **irreducible**, **driftless**, and **composable**
- examples:
  - `<generalize>` â†’ `.depth.abstract++`
    *shift focus inward toward a more abstract concept*
  - `<articulate>` â†’ `.acuity.attributes++`
    *sharpen surface details of the current concept*
  - `<decompose>` â†’ `.acuity.substructs++`
    *resolve the internal structure or components*
  - `<contrast>` â†’ `.breadth.angular++`
    *highlight peer-level differences between variants*
  - etc


---

### 5. exists `interogative.primitives`

- atomic building blocks of semantic inquiry
- used to construct **question-links** between concepts
- examples:
  - `what` â†’ identify instances or roles
  - `why` â†’ surface cause or rationale
  - `how` â†’ reveal process or transformation
  - `when`, `who`, `where` â†’ context-based locators

---

### 6. exists `focus.motion` composites

- reusable **macros** built from primitives
- encode common thought maneuvers
- examples:
  - `<zoomin>` = instantiate â†’ articulate â†’ differentiate
  - `<zoomout>` = generalize â†’ compress â†’ reframe

---

## .why = causal.motive

> to enable **structured, exhaustive, and composable thinking**

The system allows:

- **precise articulation** of mental operations
- **systematic exploration** of concept space
- **reusable routes** for semantically rich thought journeys

It builds an interface for **efficient navigation and transformation** within a complex domain.

---

## .why = causal.rational

Rooted in a progression from optics to cognition:

1. **optical.focus** = the physical narrowing of light to a plane
2. â†’ **cortal.focus** = the cognitive narrowing of meaning to a concept
3. â†’ **relative.coords** = subjective position in a semantic structure
4. â†’ **universal.coords** = fixed position within a shared treestruct

> This model simulates the way humans traverse ideas:
> through selective attention, anchored context, and question-driven motion.
