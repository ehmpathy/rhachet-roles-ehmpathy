# 🎯 .brief: `questions.have.tunable.precision`

## .what

Every **question** describes a **semantic direction** —
but the **precision** of that direction can be **tuned**.

Some questions are **rough**: they point vaguely, requiring
multiple reasoning hops to triangulate the target.
Others are **smooth**: they encode a well-shaped vector
that lands close to the desired answer in one motion.

> 🧠 question precision determines how directly a question
> moves you through concept space toward resolution.

## 🧭 the question precision spectrum

| precision      | navigation profile                              | example                                        |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **rough**       | ambiguous direction, high reasoning friction    | “What happened?”                               |
| **refined**     | partially composed, fewer hops                  | “What caused it?”                              |
| **smooth**      | precise semantic vector, lands near the target  | “What internal mechanism triggered the shift at time X?” |

> 📈 you can **tune** a question’s precision by composing it
> with additional semantic constraints — dimension by dimension.

## 🔁 how precision tunes motion

| aspect             | rough question                            | smooth question                              |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **direction**       | vague, under-specified                    | well-formed semantic vector                   |
| **turns needed**    | high — needs multiple follow-up hops      | low — may resolve directly                    |
| **semantic drift**  | common — prone to misalignment            | rare — motion pre-aligned                     |
| **agent effort**    | must infer missing context                | can execute in a single step                  |

## 🧱 mechanism: refinement = vector composition

You can increase question precision by **composing** it
across multiple semantic subaxes (e.g. causal, temporal, functional):

### progression example:

1. **rough**
   “What happened?”

2. **less rough**
   “What caused it?”

3. **refined**
   “Why did it happen now?”

4. **smooth**
   “What internal mechanism triggered this shift at time X relative to Y?”

> 🧩 Each refinement adds another **vector component**,
> tuning the question into a **more aligned motion**.

## 🪞 metaphor

> a **rough question** is like tossing a dart in the dark —
> it might land somewhere useful, but you’ll need to recalibrate.

> a **smooth question** is like a guided missile —
> it encodes heading, intent, and target into a single launch.

## 🎯 use when you want to:

- model **questions as navigational vectors**
- improve reasoning efficiency by crafting **pre-aligned asks**
- teach prompt engineering or self-questioning as **tuning for precision**
- scaffold rough queries into fluent, high-impact prompts
