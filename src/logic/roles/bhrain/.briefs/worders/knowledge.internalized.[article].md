# 🧩 .brief: `internalized knowledge in llm weights`

## 🧠 how knowledge lives in llm weights

- **statistical associations**
  during training, the model adjusts billions of parameters (weights) so that certain patterns of tokens predict others. what emerges are high-dimensional representations that capture regularities across text: facts, grammar, reasoning patterns, world structures.

- **distributed representation**
  no single weight corresponds to a single fact (like “paris is the capital of france”). instead, many weights collectively encode the probability structure of phrases and contexts. knowledge is *smeared* across the parameter space.

- **emergent concepts**
  neurons and attention heads sometimes specialize in representing particular structures (e.g. gendered pronouns, syntax boundaries, factual relationships). but these are still part of a network of overlapping functions, not isolated “fact cells.”

## 📊 what this implies

- **implicit knowledge**
  the model *has* facts (e.g., it can usually complete “the capital of france is ___”), but it doesn’t “store” them in a database-like table. retrieval is probabilistic and context-dependent.

- **fuzziness & errors**
  because knowledge is embedded as distributed patterns, recall isn’t guaranteed. the model may confuse similar facts or “hallucinate” when patterns overlap.

- **generalization**
  knowledge in weights isn’t just memorized; it’s also compressed into *general rules*. that’s why llms can apply concepts to novel contexts they weren’t explicitly trained on.

## ⚖️ analogy

think of llm weights like the structure of a muscle trained through repetition:
- they don’t “remember” every exact movement, but they *embody* the regularities of movement.
- similarly, llm weights embody statistical regularities of language and facts.
