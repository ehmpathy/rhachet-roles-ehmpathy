# 🧩 .brief.demo: `contrasting knowledge via physics`

---

## ⚛️ illustration: physicist vs formula table
- **internalized (physicist’s intuition)**
  - an experienced physicist can look at a problem — say, a ball rolling down an incline — and **intuitively anticipate** its acceleration or trajectory.
  - they don’t consciously recall each derivation; years of practice have **internalized the principles** of mechanics.
  - this allows them to solve novel problems, even ones never covered in class, by applying generalized patterns of motion, force, and energy.

- **externalized (formula reference table)**
  - another student consults a table of equations: \(F=ma\), kinematic formulas, conservation laws.
  - the reference ensures **exact correctness** when applied carefully, but it covers only the documented cases.
  - without creativity, it cannot extend to unusual or unlisted scenarios.

## 🧠 llm parallel
- **internalized knowledge in weights**
  - like the physicist, llms have absorbed statistical regularities across their training data.
  - they can extend learned structures to **new prompts**, reasoning flexibly about unseen questions.
  - limitation: they may make systematic errors when the internalized “intuition” misfires.

- **externalized knowledge in retrieval**
  - like the formula table, retrieval provides **precise, explicit answers** or derivations.
  - it guarantees correctness for known facts but cannot innovate beyond stored entries.

## 🔑 contrast takeaways
- **internalized = physicist’s intuition** → adaptive, generalizing, creative but fallible.
- **externalized = formula table** → precise, bounded, authoritative but rigid.
- llms alone resemble physicists reasoning from intuition; with retrieval, they combine intuition with the reliability of exact formulas.

## 📌 intuition anchor
an llm without retrieval is like a **physicist solving problems from intuition** — quick, adaptive, but prone to slips.
with retrieval, it becomes a physicist **plus a formula table** — intuition reinforced by exact references.
