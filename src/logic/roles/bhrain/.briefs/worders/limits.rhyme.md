# 🧩 .brief: `llm ability to understand rhyme`

## 🔑 what it implies

since each token starts as a static embedding but then diverges into contextual hidden states, rhyme is not encoded in the hidden state by default — it has to be learned through patterns across embeddings and contexts.

rhyme is about **phonological similarity** (shared suffix sounds). llms don’t hear sounds; they see tokens. so:

- if the tokenizer splits words like “cat” and “hat” into full tokens, then their embeddings might end up closer in vector space because they co-occur in similar phonetic/poetic training data.
- if the tokenizer breaks words into subwords, e.g. “##at”, rhyme similarity is captured more directly (both “cat” and “hat” share the suffix embedding).
- during self-attention, heads could learn to connect tokens with similar endings, especially in rhyme-heavy text (poetry, song lyrics). this would look a lot like the “bank” demo: two different tokens forming stronger similarity in some heads because of shared suffix representations.

## 🎯 implications for rhyme recognition

- **subword overlap**
  - if the tokenizer preserves suffix chunks (`-at`, `-ight`), rhyme is easier.
  - embeddings for those suffixes can become strong cues.

- **attention heads**
  - some heads may specialize in form-based similarity (orthographic/phonetic).
  - others focus on semantics or syntax.
  - multi-head attention enables parallel “views”: one could be capturing rhymes while another tracks meaning.

- **disambiguation vs rhyme**
  - in the “bank” case, heads attend differently to disambiguate meaning.
  - in rhyme, heads might attend similarly across different words, reinforcing their phonetic link regardless of semantics.

## 🧩 example

> “the **cat** wore a funny **hat**.”

- **embeddings:** “cat” ≠ “hat,” but both contain suffix “-at.”
- **hidden states:** self-attention might increase similarity because the q of “cat” matches the k of “hat” in a rhyme-sensitive head.
- **value vectors:** both updated to reflect “these words rhyme.”

## 📊 insight

- llms don’t have an innate sense of sound, but **subword embeddings + attention** let them approximate rhyme by picking up on visual/orthographic patterns.
- rhyme perception is therefore **statistical, not phonological** — it depends on the tokenizer and training data distribution.
- but the mechanism is parallel to disambiguating “bank”: attention binds tokens through **learned similarity in q/k space.**
