# 🧩 .brief.reflect: `interdependence of internalized and externalized knowledge`

---

## ⚛️ physics domain insight
- a **formula table** provides equations (externalized knowledge), but:
  - without knowing what “\(F\)” or “\(a\)” represent, the student cannot meaningfully use \(F=ma\).
  - they must already have **internalized fundamentals**: what force, mass, and acceleration *mean*, how they relate, and when the equation applies.
- only with that internalized base does the externalized table become **operable knowledge**.

---

## 🧠 mapping back to llms
- **retrieval (externalized)**: gives the llm a fact, equation, or passage.
- **weights (internalized)**: provide the interpretive machinery — language parsing, reasoning steps, contextual application.
- **together**: the llm can both **understand** what the retrieved info means and **apply** it productively in conversation.

---

## 🔑 reflection takeaways
- **internalized is prerequisite**: externalized knowledge is inert without an internalized framework to activate it.
- **externalized augments**: once the fundamentals are in place, external sources extend the system’s reach into precision and breadth.
- **true power lies in combination**: fluent intuition (internalized) guided by explicit reference (externalized).

## 📌 intuition anchor
a student with only a **formula sheet** but no understanding is stuck.
a student with only **intuition** risks errors.
but a student with **both** can solve a wide range of problems with accuracy and adaptability.
