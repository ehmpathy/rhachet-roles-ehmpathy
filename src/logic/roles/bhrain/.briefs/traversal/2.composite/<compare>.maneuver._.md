# 🧩 .brief: `focus.motion.compare.maneuver`

## .what
This is the **underlying motion sequence** of `<compare>` —
a structured focus maneuver that **induces a semantic dimension**
by inspecting variation across a set of descriptive peers.

Rather than being a single action, comparison unfolds as a **chain of atomic focus motions**
that reveals and **generalizes** structure latent in the semantic shell.

---

## 🧭 motion sequence

\`\`\`ts
<compare> ≈
  <gather>     // collect peers in breadth
→ <articulate> // observe raw traits of variation
→ <cluster>    // detect structural patterns
→ <generalize> // extract abstract dimension from clusters
\`\`\`

---

## 🔹 phase breakdown

### 1. `<gather>`
- collect 2+ concepts within the same `focal.depth` layer
- may be siblings along a `.breadth.[axis]`
- lays the groundwork for contrast

**example**:
In the `"domesticity"` scenario, we gather:
`[cat]`, `[dog]`, `[wolf]`, `[tiger]`, `[rabbit]`, `[hare]`
→ All live at a similar categorical depth (animal species)

---

### 2. `<articulate>`
- inspect observable traits across held concepts
- increases semantic resolution (`focal.acuity.attributes++`)
- surfaces **raw variation** (e.g. behavior, environment, breeding patterns)

**example**:

\`\`\`md
| concept  | sleeps        | behavior       | breeds exist | human-bonded |
|----------|---------------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| cat      | indoors        | calm           | ✅ yes        | ✅ yes         |
| wolf     | outdoors       | pack hunter     | ❌ no         | ❌ no          |
| rabbit   | indoors/out    | timid           | ✅ yes        | ✅ partial     |
\`\`\`

---

### 3. `<cluster>`
- detect **salient patterns** in the articulated traits
- group peers based on shared or contrasting values
- surface **latent structure** from raw variation

**example**:
The six animals fall into three emergent groups:

- **Fully domesticated** → `[cat]`, `[dog]`
- **Semi-domesticated** → `[rabbit]`
- **Wild** → `[wolf]`, `[tiger]`, `[hare]`

---

### 4. `<generalize>`
- extract the **abstract axis** that explains the clusters
- moves inward semantically (`focal.depth.abstract++`)
- defines a **dimension** for future reasoning and navigation

**example**:
→ `"domesticity"` becomes a generalized semantic axis
→ Can now be used to reason, sort, or analogize:

\`\`\`md
| concept  | domesticity score |
|----------|-------------------|
| cat      | high              |
| rabbit   | medium            |
| wolf     | low               |

## 🔁 properties

| trait                  | value                                      |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **type**               | composite maneuver                          |
| **motion profile**     | angular (breadth) + acuity + abstraction    |
| **depth shift**        | none until generalize → then inward         |
| **acuity required**    | ✅ yes — trait-level articulation            |
| **structure emergence**| in `<cluster>` and `<generalize>`           |
| **reversibility**      | ✅ (can collapse structure back to peers)    |

## 🪞 metaphor

> comparison is like **pulling a string** across multiple concepts,
> watching the **differences snap into patterns**,
> and then **naming the axis** that explains those differences.

---

## 🎯 use when you need to:

- **induce** new semantic axes from examples
- **structure** variation into meaningful contrasts
- **abstract** patterns from surface traits
- build **tools of thought** by revealing hidden gradients

> 💡 comparison is a **dimension extraction maneuver** —
> a structured motion that resolves contrast into reusable abstraction.

---

## 📌 canonical example

→ See: `.brief: compare.domesticity.example`
for a full walkthrough of inducing `"domesticity"` via comparison of `[cat]`, `[dog]`, `[wolf]`, etc.
This illustrates each motion phase — from gathering to abstracting a semantic axis.
