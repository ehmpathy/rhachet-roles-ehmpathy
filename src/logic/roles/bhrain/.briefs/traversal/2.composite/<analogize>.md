# 🔄 .brief: `focus.motion.breadth.analogize`

## .what
`<analogize>` is a **composite motion maneuver** that operates within a fixed `focal.depth` layer,
traversing angularly across the semantic shell to locate **structurally resonant peers**
— even across domains or branches of the concept.treestruct.

it is not a primitive, but a **structured combination** of focus motions
that reveals, compares, and remaps **shared functional or architectural patterns**.

## 🧭 how it works

`<analogize>` typically combines:

| step                    | motion                     | purpose                                         |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **resolve structure**    | `<decompose>` / `<articulate>` | surface internal/external structure             |
| **scan semantic shell**  | `<vary>` / `<reframe>`     | traverse angularly to candidate peers          |
| **match configuration**  | internal alignment         | select concept with mirrored structure          |
| *(optional)* **rotate axis** | `<rotate.descriptive>` | change descriptive frame (e.g. causal → functional) |

the entire maneuver stays within the same `focal.depth`,
but may observe or leverage internal substructures and abstract roles.

## 🧩 structural symmetry types

| symmetry type     | description                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **functional**      | same input/output or purpose pattern                  |
| **relational**      | same role within a larger system                      |
| **architectural**   | same configuration of components or flow              |
| **temporal**        | same sequence or phase structure                      |
| **causal**          | same force → mechanism → result pattern               |
| **subjective**      | same point-of-view or agency role                     |

## 🪞 metaphor

> `<analogize>` is like scanning the semantic shell
> for **echoes in structure**, not echoes in label.
> it finds concepts that **ring the same** even if they live in different domains.

## 🧱 classification

| property              | value                    |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **type**               | composite maneuver        |
| **motion profile**     | angular (breadth)         |
| **depth change**       | none                     |
| **structure observed** | descriptive + structural  |
| **driftless**          | ✅ (if substeps remain isolated) |

## 🎯 use it to:

- generate metaphors with real functional integrity
- align dissimilar concepts via shared architecture
- support creative modeling, pedagogy, or domain transfer
- illuminate invariant structures across contexts
