# 📄 .brief: abstraction vs reduction

## what
distinguishes two core mechanisms of understanding:
**abstraction** (zooming out to general meaning) and
**reduction** (zooming in to constituent parts)

---

## definitions

### 🔍 abstraction
- generalizes a thing by hiding irrelevant details
- shifts focus toward **essence, role, or pattern**
- enables **zooming out** along semantic or functional axes

example: `"dog"` → `"mammal"` → `"animal"`

---

### 🪓 reduction
- simplifies a thing by decomposing it into parts
- shifts focus toward **mechanism, structure, or substrate**
- enables **zooming in** along ontological or physical axes

example: `"emotion"` → `"neural activity"` → `"chemical process"`

## contrast

| axis         | abstraction                   | reduction                        |
|--------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| goal         | generalize                    | simplify                         |
| direction    | outward / upward              | inward / downward                |
| retains      | meaning, pattern              | mechanics, structure             |
| removes      | specifics, implementation     | context, gestalt                 |
| mindset      | conceptual, semantic          | analytical, structural           |

## why
useful for distinguishing between two ways of making sense of complexity:
- abstraction helps us **understand what something is**
- reduction helps us **understand how something works**
