# .brief: depth of field

## what

"Depth of field" (DoF) is the distance range within a photographed scene that appears acceptably sharp in the final image. It defines the **depth (front-to-back)** of the **field (scene)** that is in focus.

Though only a single focal plane is *perfectly* sharp, the depth of field encompasses a **zone of apparent sharpness** that extends **in front of and behind** the focal point.

## why

Depth of field is a critical creative and technical control in photography and cinematography. It shapes **visual attention**, **image clarity**, and **background separation**, and is used deliberately to either isolate a subject or keep an entire scene sharp.

---

## controlled by

- **Aperture**: wider aperture (e.g. f/1.8) → shallower DoF
- **Focal length**: longer lenses (e.g. 200mm) → shallower DoF
- **Subject distance**: closer subjects → shallower DoF
- *(Also affected by sensor size and print/viewing size at fine levels)*

---

## effects

- **Shallow DoF** → subject isolation, background blur (portrait style)
- **Deep DoF** → overall scene sharpness (landscape style)

---

## intuitive metaphors

- **Focus slice**: DoF is like a thin or thick slice of space that’s sharp
- **Butter spread**: Wide aperture = thinner spread of sharpness
- **Spotlight**: Focus is a lit zone; DoF is how wide that spotlight falls

---

## origin

The term comes from **optical science** and **early cinematography**:
- **"Field"** refers to the visible scene
- **"Depth"** refers to the distance into that scene
Together: the depth *within* the scene that stays sharp to the human eye.
