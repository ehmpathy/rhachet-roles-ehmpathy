# 🧠 Semantic vs Ontological Abstraction — Example: `"color"`

> **ontological abstraction is not a separate kind of abstraction —
> it is semantic abstraction along the specific axis of ontology**
> (i.e., the **"what kind of being is this?"** axis).

## 🎨 Term: `"color"`

We'll explore how `"color"` abstracts across multiple **semantic axes**,
including the **ontological axis**, which is a subset of semantic space.

---

### 🧠 1. Semantic Abstraction — **Functional Axis**
> “what is it used for?”

```\`\`
"color" → "visual feature" → "perceptual cue" → "communication tool"
\`\``

Abstraction by **purpose or role** in interaction or interpretation.

---

### 🧠 2. Semantic Abstraction — **Category Axis**
> “what conceptual group does it belong to?”

```\`\`
"red" → "color" → "attribute" → "qualitative descriptor"
\`\``

Abstraction by **conceptual classification** or linguistic groupings.

---

### 🧠 3. Semantic Abstraction — **Phenomenological Axis**
> “how is it experienced?”

```\`\`
"red" → "warm color" → "emotionally activating stimulus" → "affective experience"
\`\``

Abstraction by **subjective feel** or emotional effect.

---

### 🧱 4. Semantic Abstraction — **Ontological Axis**
> “what kind of thing *is* color, ontologically?”

```\`\`
"color" → "perceptual phenomenon"
       → "brain response to light wavelengths"
       → "emergent property of physical interaction"
       → "relational property (observer + light + object)"
\`\``

This is **semantic abstraction along the ontology axis** —
it traces what kind of *being* color is, not just what we call it or use it for.

| Axis              | Abstraction Path                                              | What It Generalizes                    |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Functional        | color → cue → communication tool                              | Use or purpose                         |
| Category          | red → color → attribute → descriptor                          | Conceptual or linguistic class         |
| Phenomenological  | red → warm color → emotion-linked stimulus → affective state  | Subjective experience                  |
| **Ontological**    | color → brain event → physical interaction → relational being | **Kind of being** (ontology axis)      |

## ✅ Final Insight

✔️ **Ontological abstraction is a subset of semantic abstraction**,
defined by the **axis of being**. It follows the same structure,
but its **interpretation adds existential commitment**:
> *“what kind of thing is this, really?”*
