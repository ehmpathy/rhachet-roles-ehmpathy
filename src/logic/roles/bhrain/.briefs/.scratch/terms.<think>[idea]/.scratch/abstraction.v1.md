# 📚 .brief: abstraction

## 🎯 purpose
to define **abstraction** as a general process of exploration through structured meaning,
specifically as **movement along paths in a semantic TreeStruct**.

---

## 🧠 definition

> **Abstraction** is the act of **exploring upward, outward, or across** a structured space of meaning,
> by selecting what to preserve and what to ignore in order to focus on **shared structure**, **function**, or **relevance**.

- abstraction compresses detail into **pattern**
- it generalizes **from instances to types**, **specifics to essentials**, or **context to concept**
- it allows us to **reorganize**, **relate**, or **reinterpret** ideas at different levels or through different lenses

---

## 🌲 abstraction as exploration along the semantic TreeStruct

> Abstraction is not a fixed move — it’s a **navigational act**
> through the structure of meaning (i.e., a **TreeStruct** of concepts).

- each axis of abstraction (e.g. categorical, ontological, functional) defines a **dimension** along which a TreeStruct can be built
- **nodes** represent ideas, roles, or states
- **edges** represent abstraction relationships (e.g. "is-a", "used-for", "causes")
- abstraction = selecting a **path** through that structure, depending on the context

## 🧩 dimensions of abstraction (semantic axes)

| axis            | example abstraction path                             | abstraction by...           |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **categorical**   | "dog" → "mammal" → "animal"                         | type or kind                 |
| **ontological**   | "emotion" → "neural event" → "physical process"     | kind of being                |
| **functional**    | "email" → "message" → "communication method"        | purpose or behavior          |
| **modal**         | "can walk" → "has mobility" → "has agency"          | possibility or constraint    |
| **emotional**     | "fear" → "negative affect" → "primitive alert state" | affective tone               |
| **causal**        | "match" → "ignition" → "fire source"                | mechanism or influence       |

Each of these represents a **semantic TreeStruct axis** —
abstraction moves **upward** (generalization), **outward** (reframing), or **across** (cross-linking) that space.

## ✅ summary

> ✔️ **abstraction is exploration along the semantic TreeStruct**
> — a traversal that simplifies by climbing, linking, or compressing meaning
> along one or more **semantic dimensions**.

the structure is **neutral**;
the abstraction is defined by the **path** you choose to follow.

## 🔀 7 divergent examples of abstraction as TreeStruct traversal

These examples show abstraction happening along different **semantic axes**,
each tracing a unique **path through a conceptual TreeStruct**.

---

### 1. 🐕 Categorical abstraction
```\`\`
"beagle" → "dog" → "mammal" → "animal"
\`\``
Moves up the **type hierarchy** — generalizing by **kind**

---

### 2. 🧠 Ontological abstraction
```\`\`
"emotion" → "cognitive state" → "neural event" → "physical process"
\`\``
Traces **what kind of being** something is — abstraction by **substrate**

---

### 3. 🧰 Functional abstraction
```\`\`
"hammer" → "tool" → "force applicator" → "physical actuator"
\`\``
Moves by **what it does** — generalizing function over form

---

### 4. 📩 Modal abstraction
```\`\`
"can edit" → "has permission" → "has agency" → "is an actor"
\`\``
Climbs the tree of **possibility and capability** — abstraction by **access or power**

---

### 5. ❤️ Emotional abstraction
```\`\`
"frustration" → "anger" → "negative emotion" → "affective state"
\`\``
Moves from specific feelings to broader emotional states — abstraction by **affect class**

---

### 6. 🔥 Causal abstraction
```\`\`
"friction" → "heat" → "ignition" → "fire source"
\`\``
Follows a **causal chain** upward — abstraction by **influence or effect**

---

### 7. 🖼 Structural abstraction
```\`\`
"HTML button" → "UI control" → "interactive element" → "user interface component"
\`\``
Generalizes from specific implementation to broader **structural roles**

---

> ✅ Each example represents a **different axis** of the semantic TreeStruct,
> showing how abstraction is not just upward — it’s **directional**, **dimensional**, and **purpose-driven**.
