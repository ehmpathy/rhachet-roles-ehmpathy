semantic = what does that mean?

ontologic = what i it's core?


#


semantic reduction = explaining meaning using simpler terms

ontologic reduction = explaining being using more fundamental existents


# 🧠 relationship:

semantic reduction is often a necessary tool used within ontological reduction,
but it is not sufficient by itself.

🧩 ontological reduction = answering “what kind of being is this, really?”
🧩 semantic reduction = answering “what does this concept really mean, in simpler terms?”

to reduce something ontologically, we typically have to clarify its meaning first — via semantic reduction — in order to decide what it is made of, or whether it truly exists as a distinct entity.

# 🧭 how they work together:
semantic reduction clarifies what we're even talking about

e.g. what does “emotion” mean? → “a felt experience characterized by physiological and cognitive response”

ontological reduction then asks what kind of being that maps onto

is “emotion” just a brain state?

is it more than the sum of chemicals and neurons?

is it reducible to physical substrate, or is it emergent?


# examples

## 🧠 1. Mind
Type	Example
Semantic Reduction	"Belief" means a mental representation held with some confidence.
Ontologic Reduction	Beliefs are nothing over and above brain states (e.g. neuron firing patterns).

🧩 semantic = meaning of the term
🧱 ontologic = what kind of thing exists

## 🌎 2. Planet
Type	Example
Semantic Reduction	"Planet" means a celestial body orbiting a star, massive enough to be rounded by gravity, but not clearing its orbit.
Ontologic Reduction	A planet is just an arrangement of matter governed by physics — i.e. atoms + gravity.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 3. Society
Type	Example
Semantic Reduction	"Society" means a network of individuals interacting under shared norms.
Ontologic Reduction	Society is nothing over and above the individuals and their interactions — no "group mind" exists.

## 💸 4. Money
Type	Example
Semantic Reduction	"Money" means a medium of exchange accepted for goods and services.
Ontologic Reduction	Money just is physical tokens or digital entries plus shared belief — it has no objective value beyond that.

## 🎭 5. Identity
Type	Example
Semantic Reduction	"Identity" means the set of traits, roles, and self-conceptions that define a person.
Ontologic Reduction	Identity is reducible to physical bodies + psychological states + social labels — no extra "essence" needed.

# ✍️ takeaway:
Semantic = asks	“what does the term mean?”
Ontologic = asks	“what kind of thing is it really?”

the first is linguistic/conceptual, the second is metaphysical.
