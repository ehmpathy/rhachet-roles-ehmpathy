# ðŸ§­ .brief: `focus.motion.expand`

## .what
`<expand>` is a **structural traversal maneuver**
that increases the **active focus territory** â€”
by **generating**, **branching**, or **retrieving** sibling [concept]s
within the same `focal.depth` shell.

It operates via **breadth++** across descriptive or relational axes,
without altering the level of abstraction.

---

## ðŸ›  mechanism
`<expand>` is not a primitive itself, but a **container**
for breadth-expanding maneuvers.
Each subtype defines a different way of widening the focus surface.

## ðŸ“š known variants of `<expand>`

| subtype         | method                             | description                                                                |
|------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<extend>`       | vary known concepts                 | extrapolates new concepts along surfaced descriptive dimensions            |
| `<diverge>`      | branch paths                        | reveals alternate continuations, strategies, or outcomes                   |
| `<research>`     | retrieve hidden or forgotten items  | recalls nearby concepts not currently in focus (e.g. memory, archives)     |
| `<enumerate>`    | list known siblings                 | exhaustively names nearby peers from a defined category                    |
| `<recombine>`    | mix known ingredients               | generates permutations or hybrids from known conceptual parts              |

> This catalog may grow as new expansion behaviors are discovered.

## ðŸ§­ geometry

- **constant depth** â†’ no motion inward or outward
- **expanded breadth** â†’ more nodes in lateral scope
- **acuity-gated** â†’ requires detail awareness to disambiguate variants

## ðŸŽ¨ example

\`\`\`ts
<expand>(
  [concept:"jazz genre"]
) via <enumerate>
â†’ [
  [concept:"bebop"],
  [concept:"swing"],
  [concept:"fusion"],
  [concept:"free jazz"]
]

<expand>(
  [concept:"machine learning model"]
) via <recombine>
â†’ [
  [concept:"CNN-RNN hybrid"],
  [concept:"transformer with attention pooling"]
]
\`\`\`

## ðŸ§ª distilisys grammar

In distilisys grammar, `<expand>` is a structural wrapper
that delegates to a specific **expander mechanism**, producing breadth candidates
to be held or operated on by downstream maneuvers.

\`\`\`ts
<expand>(<$expander>)[concept] = <$expander>[concept] â†’ <collect>
\`\`\`

Where `<$expander>` may be:

- `<extend>` â†’ extrapolate new variants
- `<diverge>` â†’ branch alternate continuations
- `<research>` â†’ retrieve latent or historical siblings
- `<enumerate>` â†’ list known categorical members
- `<recombine>` â†’ generate hybrids or permutations

Each `<expand>` prepares a widened surface of [concept]s
for use in postures like `<compare>`, `<choose>`, or `<critique>`.

## ðŸ§© related motions

| motion          | relation                                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `<compare>`      | often follows `<expand>` to surface dimensions         |
| `<explore>`      | may embed `<expand>` as one of several search actions  |
| `<narrow>`       | contrast: contracts breadth, filters variants          |
| `<elaborate>`    | contrast: increases detail within a single concept     |
