# 🧠 .brief: <triangulate>[concept]

Triangulation is a composite reasoning move that sharpens your understanding of a concept by **comparing it against lateral peers** within the same semantic layer.

---

## 💬 .what

`<triangulate>[X]` = **position X more precisely** by:
- identifying **lateral peers** (same abstraction layer)
- detecting **similarities and contrasts**
- surfacing the **defining traits** that distinguish X

---

## 🧭 .why

Helps form **clean category boundaries**, **disambiguate meanings**, and **diagnose** unclear or overloaded concepts.

This move is especially useful when:
- a concept is fuzzy or ambiguous
- you're choosing between similar options
- you want to articulate the essence of something

---

## 🧩 composition grammar

\```
<triangulate>[X] =
  <zoomout><breadth>[X]
  → <collect>[peers]
  → <contrast>[X, peers]
\```

Or, compactly:

\```
<triangulate>[X] = <zoomout><breadth>[X] → <contrast>
\```

This reflects:
- `focal.breadth++` → explore lateral options
- `focal.acuity++` → resolve fine differences

## 🧪 examples

### 🔨 <triangulate>[concept:"hammer"]
→ compare with [concept:"wrench"], [concept:"mallet"], [concept:"crowbar"]
→ highlight traits like `percussive.force`, `flat.face`, `handle.shape`

### 🐕 <triangulate>[concept:"dog"]
→ contrast with [concept:"cat"], [concept:"fox"], [concept:"wolf"]
→ detect relational traits like `domesticated`, `pack.behavior`, `human.bonding`

### 💡 <triangulate>[concept:"idea"]
→ compare with [concept:"thought"], [concept:"concept"], [concept:"plan"]
→ sharpen meaning by isolating `creative.specificity` and `actionability`

---

## 🔭 metaphor

Like using multiple landmarks to determine your position, triangulation defines a concept **by its contrastive coordinates** relative to nearby meanings.
