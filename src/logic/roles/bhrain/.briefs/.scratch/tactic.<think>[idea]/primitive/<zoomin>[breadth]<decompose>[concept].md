# 🎯 .brief: <zoomin>[breadth]<decompose>[concept]

## .what
`<decompose>` increases **focal breadth** around a concept by surfacing its **internal components**, **parts**, or **dimensions**.
It is a **zoom-in operation on breadth**: widening the focus *within* the concept to reveal its **semantic neighbors held inside**.

Unlike abstraction or sharpening, **decomposition** explores what the concept **contains**, not what it belongs to, or how fine each trait is.

---

## 🧠 how it works
- `focal.breadth++`
- `focal.depth = const`
- `focal.acuity = const`

→ You stay at the **same semantic depth**, but attend to **more neighbor components** or **sub-concepts** that make up the whole.

## 🧪 examples

### 🧰 concept: `"toolbox"`
Decomposable by:
- **contents** → what it holds
  - [concept:"hammer"], [concept:"wrench"], [concept:"screwdriver"], [concept:"tape measure"]
- **construction** → how it's built
  - [concept:"hinge"], [concept:"latch"], [concept:"handle"], [concept:"tray insert"]
- **chronical** → when and how it's used
  - [concept:"daily maintenance"], [concept:"emergency repairs"], [concept:"project kickoff"], [concept:"seasonal cleanup"]

---

### 🧪 concept: `"experiment"`
Decomposable by:
- **logical structure**: [concept:"hypothesis"], [concept:"variables"], [concept:"conclusion"]
- **temporal phases**: [concept:"setup"], [concept:"execution"], [concept:"analysis"]
- **roles involved**: [concept:"researcher"], [concept:"subject"], [concept:"observer"]

---

### 🏠 concept: `"home"`
Decomposable by:
- **spaces**: [concept:"bedroom"], [concept:"kitchen"], [concept:"garage"]
- **functions**: [concept:"resting"], [concept:"cooking"], [concept:"storage"]
- **utilities**: [concept:"plumbing"], [concept:"electricity"], [concept:"heating"]

## 📐 metaphor
- like **opening up a container** to see what’s inside
- like **zooming in laterally** across its internal slots

---

## 🔁 related operations
- `<zoomin>[acuity]<sharpen>[concept]` → increases detail per trait
- `<zoomin>[depth]<abstractify>[concept]` → moves inward toward general meaning
- `<zoomout>[breadth]` → includes more **peers**, not parts

---

## 🔦 when to use
- to **analyze internal structure**
- to **unpack meaning** without changing abstraction level
- for **planning**, **diagnosis**, or **curriculum design**

> **Decompose** reveals *what it contains*, not what it is like.
