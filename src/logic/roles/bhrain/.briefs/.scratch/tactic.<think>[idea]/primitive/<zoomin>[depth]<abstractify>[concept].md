# 🕳️ .brief: `<zoomin>[depth]<abstractify>[concept]`

## .what
**`<abstractify>`** moves **inward** toward **more general, inclusive abstractions** — traveling **radially toward the core** of concept space.

It performs a **`focal.depth++`** operation:
- deepens focus by including **higher-level abstractions**
- does **not increase neighbor context** (`breadth`) or **attribute granularity** (`acuity`)
- focuses on **semantic compression** — revealing what the concept **is an instance of**

> Imagine standing on a branch and tracing it inward toward the trunk.

---

## 🧭 direction

This is a **radial inward motion**:
- from a **relative anchor** concept
- toward **increasingly abstract** root concepts
- in the **universal perspective**, this is always inward on the RootStruct

---

## 🎯 .why

Abstraction allows us to:
- **reduce complexity** in cognition and communication
- **surface essential structure** and ignore noise
- **enable reuse**, analogy, comparison, and category formation

---

## 🌱 how it works

`<abstractify>` can operate via two major methods:

### 1. by **reducing attributes**
Strip away specific features until only a general structure remains.

\\```txt
"banana" → "elongated edible plant part" → "plant organ" → "thing"
\\```

### 2. by **comparing and linking neighbors**
Find common ground among neighboring concepts, and abstract to their shared parent.

#### grammar:
\\```txt
[origin:concept] <-> [link:concept] <-> [neighbor:concept]
\\```

#### neighbor types:
- **link.included neighbor** → supports abstraction path
- **link.excluded neighbor** → shows where abstraction fails

#### e.g.
\\```txt
"banana" <-> "fruit" <-> "orange"       // included
"banana" <-> "food" <-> "bread"         // included
"banana" <-> "thing" <-> "joke"         // excluded
→ "banana" → "concept"
\\```

## 🎯 examples: `<abstractify>[concept]` in multiple directions

### 🍌 concept: `"banana"`
- **categorical**: `"banana"` → `"fruit"` → `"food"` → `"item"`
- **functional**: `"banana"` → `"snack"` → `"meal component"` → `"experience"`
- **biological**: `"banana"` → `"plant organ"` → `"vegetative structure"` → `"organism part"`

---

### 🧰 concept: `"toolbox"`
- **categorical**: `"toolbox"` → `"storage container"` → `"object"`
- **functional**: `"toolbox"` → `"tool organizer"` → `"workflow enabler"` → `"support structure"`
- **contextual**: `"toolbox"` → `"repair accessory"` → `"worksite object"` → `"task-enabling thing"`

---

### 🔋 concept: `"battery"`
- **categorical**: `"battery"` → `"electrical component"` → `"device"` → `"object"`
- **functional**: `"battery"` → `"energy storage"` → `"power medium"` → `"utility function"`
- **capability**: `"battery"` → `"power source"` → `"resource"` → `"capacity"`

---

### 🧼 concept: `"soap"`
- **categorical**: `"soap"` → `"cleaning product"` → `"chemical compound"` → `"substance"`
- **functional**: `"soap"` → `"dirt remover"` → `"hygiene tool"` → `"health facilitator"`
- **social**: `"soap"` → `"bathroom staple"` → `"cultural hygiene norm"` → `"societal practice"`

---

## 🚫 .not

`<abstractify>` is **not**:
- **vagueness** — it does not remove detail arbitrarily
- **ambiguity** — it does not introduce confusion
- **accidental omission** — abstraction is **intentional and structured**

---

## 🧪 examples: other domains

- **code**:
  `function add(a, b)` — hides implementation, reveals structural pattern
- **map**:
  subway diagram — omits geography, reveals logical connections
- **language**:
  `"vehicle"` — abstracts over car, bike, truck, etc.
- **ethics**:
  `"justice"` — generalizes across legal frameworks

---

## 🧠 cognitive role

- enables **generalization**, **categorization**, **theory-building**
- supports **analogy formation** by grouping under shared roots
- good for **semantic compression**, **vocabulary alignment**, and **domain modeling**

→ Use `<abstractify>` when you want to **understand what a concept is**, and how it connects upward in your mental model.
