# 🌱 .brief: `<zoomout>[depth]<elaborate>[concept]`

## .what
**`<elaborate>`** moves **outward** from a conceptual anchor, revealing **examples**, **variants**, or **subtypes** that reside further along the same semantic path.

It performs a **`focal.depth++`** operation:
- **deepening outward**, not inward
- expands your view **away from the universal abstraction core**, into more **concrete**, **specialized**, or **differentiated** expressions of the concept

> You remain centered on a concept, but shine your focus beam deeper **toward the semantic periphery** — revealing what it **contains**, **produces**, or **becomes**.

---

## 🧭 direction
This is **radial motion outward**:
- relative depth increases from your current anchor
- each outward step increases specificity
- **rootward** compression reverses into **leafward** elaboration

---

## 🌳 how it works

`<elaborate>` explores **example concepts** that are:
- more **specific**
- more **constrained**
- more **contextually bound**
- more **instantiated**

> These are not “parts” (decomposition), but **subtypes**, **refinements**, or **real-world cases** of the anchor concept.

## 🎯 examples: `<elaborate>[concept]` in multiple directions

### 🍌 concept: `"banana"`

- **biological**: `"banana"` → `"cavendish banana"` → `"dwarf cavendish banana"`
- **functional**: `"banana"` → `"banana used in smoothies"` → `"banana in green detox smoothie"`
- **modal**: `"banana"` → `"overripe banana"` → `"banana for baking"`

---

### 🧰 concept: `"toolbox"`

- **categorical**: `"toolbox"` → `"carpenter's toolbox"` → `"wooden hinged toolbox with compartments"`
- **functional**: `"toolbox"` → `"emergency repair kit"` → `"bike roadside repair set"`
- **chronical**: `"toolbox"` → `"toolbox from 1980s"` → `"Soviet-era electrician’s box"`

---

### 🔋 concept: `"battery"`

- **categorical**: `"battery"` → `"LiFePO₄ battery"` → `"cold-rated LiFePO₄ battery with BMS"`
- **form-factor**: `"battery"` → `"18650-format battery"` → `"protected 18650 cell"`
- **application**: `"battery"` → `"drone battery"` → `"quadcopter LiPo battery"`

---

### 🧼 concept: `"soap"`

- **use case**: `"soap"` → `"hand soap"` → `"antibacterial foam soap"`
- **form factor**: `"soap"` → `"bar soap"` → `"triple-milled French bar soap"`
- **ingredient**: `"soap"` → `"olive oil soap"` → `"castile soap"`

---

## 🧠 cognitive role

- builds **semantic richness** from a known node
- enables **example generation**, **training instance creation**, **specialization**
- helps refine concepts into more usable forms

→ Use `<elaborate>` when you want to **see what your concept contains** or **how it expresses concretely** across contexts.
