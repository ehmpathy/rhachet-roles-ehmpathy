# 🎯 .brief: <zoomout>[acuity]<blurren>[concept]

## .what
`<blurren>` reduces **focal acuity** on a concept — not by abstracting it, but by **tracking fewer internal attributes**.

It is a **zoom-out operation on acuity**:
you still refer to the **same concept**, but your cognitive lens treats it more **coarsely**, **loosely**, or **holistically**.

---

## 🧠 how it works
- `focal.acuity--`
- `focal.depth = const`
- `focal.breadth = const`

→ **same concept**, lower internal resolution
→ you attend to **fewer traits**, dimensions, or features
→ not abstraction — just **fuzzy focus**

---

## 🧪 examples

### 🔨 concept: `"hammer"`
- sharpened: tracks `handle.material`, `head.weight`, `impact.type`
- blurred: just “a thing for hitting”

### 🐕 concept: `"dog"`
- sharpened: tracks `breed`, `size`, `temperament`, `purpose`
- blurred: just “a dog”

### 🥝 concept: `"kiwi"`
- sharpened: tracks `flesh.color`, `skin.hairs`, `acidity.level`, `origin.region`
- blurred: just “a fruit you eat with a spoon”

## 📐 metaphor
- like **softening the focus** of a camera — the object stays, but details are less crisp
- like glancing at something instead of inspecting it

---

## 🔁 related operations
- `<zoomin>[acuity]<sharpen>[concept]` → increases trait tracking
- `<zoomout>[depth]<elaborate>[concept]` → adds more examples or instances
- `<zoomout>[breadth]` → includes more peers

---

## 🔦 when to use
- for **quick judgments**, **category tagging**, or **low-effort recall**
- to reduce detail load in working memory
- to treat a concept as **symbolic**, **metaphoric**, or **general-purpose**

> **Blurren** simplifies by looking *less closely* — not by generalizing away.
