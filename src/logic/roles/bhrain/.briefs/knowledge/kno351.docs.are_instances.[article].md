# 🧩 .brief.article: `documents as instances`

## .what
all **documents** are themselves **instances of their document type** (article, catalog, demo, lesson).
because documents are created from instances, they in turn can serve as **instances for new documents**, enabling recursive knowledge-building.

---

## 🔬 definition
- **duality:** a document is both
  - a **materialization of a concept** (built from instances of reality), and
  - an **instance itself** (of the document type, usable as input).
- **mechanism:** documents can reference, incorporate, or organize other documents as if they were instances.
- **implication:** knowledge systems are cumulative and self-referential, layering documents upon documents.

---

## 📌 examples
- 📖 an *article* on gravity → becomes an instance in a 🗂️ catalog of scientific papers.
- 🎬 a *demo* of empathy in a nurse–patient interaction → becomes an instance in a 📖 article defining empathy.
- 🗂️ a *catalog* of philosophical texts → becomes an instance in a 🎓 lesson on the history of philosophy.
- 🎓 a *lesson* on climate change → becomes an instance in a 🗂️ catalog of teaching curricula.

## ✨ insight
- all documents are **instances of type**.
- documents can serve as **input instances** for new documents.
- this recursive structure explains how **knowledge accumulates and evolves**:
  - concepts are materialized as documents,
  - documents become instances,
  - new documents materialize from those instances.

in knowledge architecture, this principle underpins the **layered ecology of documents**, where works are both **outputs** and **inputs** in the ongoing materialization of concepts.
