# 🧩 .brief: `from instances to documents.briefs`

## .what
**instances** (🔹 observations: data, events, specimens, cases) are the raw substrate of knowledge.
**documents.briefs** (📝 compressed references) are structured, high-density articulations of concepts.
a brief emerges by **selecting, arranging, and compressing instances** to materialize a concept with maximal clarity.

## ⚙️ process

1. **collect instances**
   - gather relevant observations tied to the concept
   - e.g., apples falling, planets orbiting, ocean tides

2. **select for salience**
   - choose the most representative instances
   - filter out noise or redundancies

3. **arrange structurally**
   - organize chosen instances into a compact narrative or argument
   - highlight how they reveal the concept’s pattern or principle

4. **compress articulation**
   - distill explanation into a few paragraphs
   - ensure maximum signal, minimal noise

## 📌 example: gravity

- 🔹 **instances:** apple falling, moon orbit, ocean tides
- 📝 **brief.article:** a 3-paragraph compressed articulation:
  - defines gravity as attraction of masses
  - relates with the falling apple and lunar orbit
  - explains significance for physics and daily life

## ✨ insight
- **instances supply the evidence**
- **briefs supply the compressed articulation**
- the act of making a brief is the act of **curating and condensing instances** so the concept becomes both perceptible and transmissible in minimal space.

briefs are thus **concept-materializations distilled through selective instance organization**.
