# 🧩 instances, documents, and multiple concepts

## 1. instances are polyvalent
- the same set of raw observations can support different patterns.
- instances do not “belong” to one concept — they remain neutral evidence until organized.

---

## 2. documents frame the pattern
- **articles**: arrange the same events into different narratives (e.g., “progress” vs. “conflict”).
- **catalogs**: classify the same items by different principles (e.g., “evolutionary lineage” vs. “ecological role”).
- **demos**: show the same behavior as “leadership” in one framing, or as “manipulation” in another.
- **lessons**: use the same experiments to teach “gravity” in physics, or “scientific method” in education.

---

## 3. concepts coexist
- multiple concepts can be validly materialized from the same evidentiary base.
- what changes is the **treatment**: the way instances are arranged into a document.

## 🔗 example

**instances:** events of the French Revolution (1789–1799)

- **concept = revolution** → article: “the nature of political revolutions”
- **concept = progress** → lesson: “steps toward modern democracy”
- **concept = conflict** → demo: “case study of class struggle”
- **concept = human nature** → catalog: “patterns of collective behavior under stress”

---

## ✨ insight
- **instances are concept-neutral** until organized.
- **documents are concept-detection and transmission devices** that surface different concepts from the same raw material.
- explains why different disciplines (history, sociology, economics) can study the same dataset and yield distinct conceptual insights.
