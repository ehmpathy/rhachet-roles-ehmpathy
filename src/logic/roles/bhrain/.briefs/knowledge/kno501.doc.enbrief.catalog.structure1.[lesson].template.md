# üß© .brief.lesson: `catalogize` via `template`

## üí° concept
to **catalogize** is to organize a set of `$subconcept`s under a `$concept` by arranging them into a structured overview and expanded clusters, so relationships become clear and referenceable.

## üìä compressed overview

| **cluster** | **what** | **[optional column]** |
|-------------|----------|------------------------|
| **[$subconcept a]** | [short definition or identifying phrase] | [optional info] |
| **[$subconcept b]** | [short definition or identifying phrase] | [optional info] |
| **[$subconcept c]** | [short definition or identifying phrase] | [optional info] |

## üé® clusters

### üçé **[$subconcept a] ‚Äî [role/essence]**
[short description of this cluster]
- point one
- point two
  - subpoint a
  - subpoint b
- point three

---

### üçå **[$subconcept b] ‚Äî [role/essence]**
[short description of this cluster]
- attribute one
- attribute two

---

### üçá **[$subconcept c] ‚Äî [role/essence]**
[short description of this cluster]
- step one
  - detail a
  - detail b
    - finer detail i
    - finer detail ii
- step two

## üõ†Ô∏è practice
> how to fill out the template

1. **select a `$concept` domain**
   - choose the overarching concept you want to organize (e.g., ‚Äúdocument archetypes,‚Äù ‚Äúfruit types,‚Äù ‚Äúproject risks‚Äù).
   - this sets the *scope* of your catalog ‚Äî too broad and it becomes messy, too narrow and it loses utility.

2. **define your table columns**
   - the first column must always be **cluster** (naming each `$subconcept`).
   - add columns that match what you want to compare:
     - **what** ‚Üí short definition (default, highly recommended)
     - **how** ‚Üí method, process, or mechanism
     - **why** ‚Üí purpose, role, or motivation
     - **when / where** ‚Üí context or conditions of relevance
   - remember: the table is a compressed overview, not a data dump.

3. **draft the compressed overview**
   - list each `$subconcept` cluster with:
     - a **name/label** (clear and recognizable)
     - a **one-liner ‚Äúwhat‚Äù** definition
     - optional supporting info in extra columns
   - aim for *scan-ability*: someone should understand the whole landscape at a glance.

4. **expand each cluster**
   - mark each cluster header with a **unique emoji**, not a number.
     - emojis act as **visual tags**, making clusters distinct and instantly recognizable.
     - choose emojis that symbolize or hint at the `$subconcept`.
   - begin with a **short description** (1‚Äì3 sentences) that anchors what the cluster is about.
   - follow with a **nested outline** that is **flexible and topic-dependent**.
     - some clusters may take the shape of attributes, others steps, others categories, or even mixed forms.
     - outlines should not all look the same; in fact, if every cluster matches the example above exactly, it‚Äôs a sign the catalog is being filled mechanically rather than thoughtfully.

5. **distill insights**
   - once all clusters are drafted, look across them:
     - **verbs** ‚Üí reduce each cluster to its action (‚Äúarticles define,‚Äù ‚Äúcatalogs organize‚Äù)
     - **relationships** ‚Üí highlight how clusters contrast, complement, or overlap
     - **system takeaway** ‚Üí explain why the `$concept` matters as a whole, beyond the sum of parts

## üéØ goal
after completing this lesson, you should be able to **catalogize any `$concept` into its `$subconcept` clusters** with a flexible combination of overview tables + emoji-marked descriptive outlines. the *shape of each outline should vary with the topic*, ensuring the catalog balances quick reference with deeper exploration.
