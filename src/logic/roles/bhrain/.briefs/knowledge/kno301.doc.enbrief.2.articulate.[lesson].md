# üß© .brief.lesson: `how to articulate an article`

## .what
an **article** is a document that gives a **definitional treatment** of a concept: it clarifies *what the concept is*, often by setting boundaries, tracing meaning, and relating to representative instances.
this lesson shows step by step how to **articulate an article** effectively.

## üéì steps

1. **identify the concept**
   - choose the subject of articulation (e.g., ‚Äúsymmetry‚Äù)
   - state it clearly in one sentence as the anchor

2. **define the essence**
   - provide a concise definition: *what it is at its core*
   - ensure the definition distinguishes the concept from related ones

3. **relate with instances**
   - select 1‚Äì3 representative cases that make the definition tangible
   - show how each instance fits the boundaries of the concept

4. **contextualize**
   - situate the concept in a larger frame: its domain, contrasts, or history
   - explain why the concept matters or how it functions in practice

5. **compress into structure**
   - arrange into a few short, well-ordered paragraphs
   - ensure clarity, minimal noise, maximum signal

## üìå example: articulate an article on ‚Äúsymmetry‚Äù

- **definition:** symmetry is a structural property where an object remains invariant under a transformation (e.g., reflection, rotation).
- **instances:** butterfly wings (reflection), square (rotation), musical phrase (repetition).
- **context:** symmetry is central in mathematics, physics, and aesthetics; it reveals order and regularity in systems.
- **compression:** three paragraphs, moving from definition ‚Üí examples ‚Üí significance.

## ‚ú® insight
to articulate an article:
- start with a **clear definition**
- **relate with key instances** to ground it
- **situate in context** for meaning
- **compress** into structured paragraphs for clarity

this sequence ensures the article functions as a **definitional treatment** that makes the concept graspable and transmissible.
