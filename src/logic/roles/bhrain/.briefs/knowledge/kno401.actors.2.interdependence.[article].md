# 🧩 .brief.catalog: `author ↔ librarian`

## .what
**authors** and **librarians** are interdependent mechanisms in the knowledge ecology.
- 📖 **authors** materialize **documents from instances** (observations + documents).
- 🗂️ **librarians** collect and curate **instances** (observations and documents) into accessible, preserved systems.
this interdependence forms a loop: authors rely on librarians to supply instances, and librarians rely on authors to generate new documents to collect.

## 🔬 functions compared

### 📖 author
- **concept selection** → chooses which idea to materialize.
- **instance gathering** → draws from reality *and* from preserved collections.
- **treatment choice** → decides between article, catalog, demo, or lesson.
- **composition** → structures instances into a coherent document.
- **expression** → shapes language and style for audience.

### 🗂️ librarian
- **selection** → curates both observations (specimens, datasets) and documents.
- **classification** → organizes them into catalogs, indexes, and metadata.
- **navigation** → provides pathways for authors and readers to find instances.
- **preservation** → maintains continuity of both raw data and documents.
- **contextualization** → links instances so they can be meaningfully reused.

## 📌 examples

- **science:**
  - librarian preserves **specimens** (observation-instances) and **journals** (document-instances).
  - author consults both to write an article on a new species.
  - librarian then collects the new article into the archive, completing the loop.

- **philosophy:**
  - librarian preserves **ancient manuscripts** (document-instances) and **oral traditions/notes** (observation-instances).
  - author draws on them to articulate a new article or construct a lesson.
  - librarian curates the new works into the philosophical canon.

## ✨ insight
- **authors** depend on librarians for access to *instances of reality* (observations preserved) and *instances of knowledge* (documents preserved).
- **librarians** depend on authors to expand the corpus of documents worth curating.
- together, they sustain a **two-way loop**:
  1. librarians collect → preserve instances.
  2. authors use instances → create documents.
  3. librarians curate documents → collections.
  4. authors return to collections → draw instances.

this makes authors and librarians **mutually constitutive**: without librarians, authors lack access to accumulated instances; without authors, librarians lack new material to curate.
