# üß© .brief.article: `catalogize`

## .what
**catalogize** is the mechanism that **instantiates catalogs**: it materializes a concept as an organizational treatment that maps how its instances or sub-concepts relate within a system.

---

## üî¨ definition
- **mechanism:** the materialization of a concept *as* catalog form.
- **function:** organizes instances into clusters, categories, or hierarchies to reveal structure and variation.
- **distinction:** articulation describes *what a catalog is*; catalogizing performs the *instantiation* of a catalog.

---

## üìå examples
- to catalogize ‚Äúmemory,‚Äù one groups instances into **short-term vs. long-term**, then subdivides into **declarative vs. procedural**.
- to catalogize ‚Äúcolor,‚Äù one organizes by **hue, saturation, brightness** or by **additive vs. subtractive models**.
- to catalogize ‚Äújokes,‚Äù one maps types like **puns, anecdotes, slapstick, anti-jokes**.

## ‚ú® insight
**catalogize** is the bridge between **concept and structure**:
- it is the **mechanism** of arranging instances to make a system visible.
- it ensures that catalogs are not random lists but **systematic materializations** of conceptual organization.

in knowledge architecture, **catalogize** sits alongside mechanisms like **articulate** (articles), **demonstrate** (demos), and **lessonize** (lessons), each materializing concepts in a distinct document mode.
