# üß© .brief.lesson: `how to catalogize a catalog`

## .what
a **catalog** is a document that gives an **organizational treatment** of a concept: it maps *how instances or sub-concepts relate* within a system.
this lesson shows step by step how to **catalogize a catalog** ‚Äî i.e., how to instantiate a catalog so its structure clearly materializes the concept.

## üéì steps

1. **identify the scope**
   - choose the domain of organization (e.g., ‚Äútypes of memory‚Äù)
   - define boundaries: what belongs in the catalog, what doesn‚Äôt

2. **collect instances**
   - gather relevant cases or sub-concepts
   - ensure diversity, so the catalog reflects breadth

3. **group by principle**
   - decide the organizing logic (taxonomy, dimensions, categories, functions)
   - examples: short-term vs long-term memory; declarative vs procedural

4. **name and order clusters**
   - assign clear labels to each group
   - order them logically (hierarchy, chronology, continuum, network)

5. **compress into structure**
   - write each group with a short description
   - present the whole as a coherent, navigable map

## üìå example: catalogize a catalog of ‚Äúmemory‚Äù

- **scope:** human memory
- **instances:** remembering a phone number, recalling facts, knowing how to ride a bike
- **groups:**
  - **short-term memory** ‚Üí holding a phone number briefly
  - **long-term memory** ‚Üí stored knowledge and skills
     - **declarative** (facts/events)
     - **procedural** (skills/habits)
- **compression:** sections for each cluster, presented hierarchically

## ‚ú® insight
to catalogize a catalog:
- **scope** defines what‚Äôs included
- **instances** supply the raw material
- **grouping principles** shape the structure
- **labels + order** make it navigable
- **compression** ensures clarity

a catalog succeeds when it reveals the **systematic structure** of a concept, turning scattered instances into an organized map.
