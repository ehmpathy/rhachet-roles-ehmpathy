# 🧩 .brief.demo: `brief archetypes via color`

## .what
the same **instances** (🌈 prism spectrum, 📱 rgb display, 🎨 paint mixing, 👗 “the dress” illusion) can be compressed into different **brief archetypes**.
this demo shows how **color** is materialized differently depending on the treatment: definitional, organizational, relational, or pedagogical.

---

## 📖 brief.article — definitional
**treatment:** clarify *what color is*
**content:**
- defines color as a **perceptual attribute** arising from a stimulus’s spectral power distribution **as interpreted by the human visual system** (cone responses and opponent channels)
- relates with additive light mixing (rgb on a display) vs subtractive pigment mixing (cmyk/paint) and notes **color constancy** (perceived color stabilizes across lighting)

---

## 🗂️ brief.catalog — organizational
**treatment:** map *how color varies*
**content:**
- **physical:** wavelength/spectrum, illuminant, reflectance
- **physiological:** l/m/s cones; opponent axes (red↔green, blue↔yellow)
- **psychophysical:** hue, saturation/chroma, lightness/value
- **representational:** rgb, cmyk, cie xyY / lab / lch; device gamut
- **contextual phenomena:** constancy, adaptation, metamerism, simultaneous contrast
- relates these lenses as complementary slices of one concept

---

## 🎬 brief.demo — relational
**treatment:** show *how one instance exemplifies color*
**content:**
- takes **“the dress”** photo as the focal instance
- relates how **assumed illuminant** (cool shadow vs warm spotlight) shifts perceived white balance, yielding **blue/black** vs **white/gold**
- bridges to color constancy and the role of priors/context in perception

## 🎓 brief.lesson — pedagogical
**treatment:** guide *how to learn color step by step*
**content:**
1. view a phone screen through a macro lens to see **rgb subpixels** (additive mixing)
2. mix **cyan, magenta, yellow** paints to feel subtractive interactions
3. compare two lights that look the **same color** but have **different spectra** (metamers)
4. try a checker-shadow or gray-bar illusion to feel **context effects**
5. plot a few samples in **cie lab** to connect perception to coordinates
- relates hands-on activities to the principles of spectrum → cones → appearance → color spaces

## ✨ insight
- 📖 **article** defines
- 🗂️ **catalog** organizes
- 🎬 **demo** exemplifies
- 🎓 **lesson** teaches

one concept, **color**, becomes graspable through different brief treatments, each relating shared instances in a distinct way.
