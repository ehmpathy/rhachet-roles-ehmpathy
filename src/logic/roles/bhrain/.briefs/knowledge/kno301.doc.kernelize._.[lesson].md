# 🧩 .brief.lesson: `how to <kernelize>`

## 💡 concept
**<kernelize>** is the practice of extracting 🌱 **doc.kernels** — the atomic, fertile units of concepts — from any 📚 **doc**.
most docs contain **many concepts**, often mixed together.
the goal of <kernelize> is to harvest **each concept individually** in its minimal viable form.

---

## 🎯 learning goals
- recognize that a single doc typically contains **multiple concepts**
- practice isolating and extracting **one kernel per concept**
- compare kernels to 🔖 refs (pointers) and 🪴 briefs (structured articulations)

---

## 🛠️ method

### step 1: scan for concepts
- read through the 📚 doc (transcript, notes, essay, article).
- underline every sentence or clause that carries a **distinct idea**.

---

### step 2: isolate each idea
- separate intertwined sentences into discrete conceptual units.
- treat each idea as a candidate for its own kernel.

---

### step 3: reduce to the irreducible
- rewrite each idea in its **shortest viable form**.
- test: *if I cut further, does the concept break?*
- keep only **one concept per kernel**.

---

### step 4: declare as kernels
- format each idea as a 🌱 **doc.kernel**.
- a single doc may yield a **set of kernels** — one per concept.

## 📌 practice examples

### ⚖️ gravity (from a lecture transcript)
> *“so, basically, the reason the apple falls is because earth pulls on it with a force — and actually, any two masses in the universe attract each other, that’s Newton’s big insight.”*

kernels extracted:
- 🌱 `earth pulls on the apple`
- 🌱 `any two masses attract each other`
- 🌱 `Newton identified universal gravitation as a key insight`

---

### 🎵 music (from a conversation)
> *“when you line up sounds in rhythm and melody, suddenly it feels like music instead of just noise. and harmony is what makes it feel rich.”*

kernels extracted:
- 🌱 `organized sound creates aesthetic experience`
- 🌱 `rhythm and melody distinguish music from noise`
- 🌱 `harmony creates richness in music`

---

### 🧩 triangle (from a textbook)
> *“a triangle is defined as a polygon with three sides, three angles, and the sum of its angles equal to 180°.”*

kernels extracted:
- 🌱 `a triangle has three sides`
- 🌱 `a triangle has three angles`
- 🌱 `the sum of a triangle’s angles is 180°`

---

## ✨ reflection
- 📚 docs = soils full of **many concepts** (entangled, verbose, raw).
- 🔖 refs = labels into concepts (*“gravity”*, *“music”*).
- 🌱 kernels = harvested seeds, **one per concept**.
- 🪴 briefs = portable pots, where kernels are transplanted and structured.

---

## 🧠 takeaway
to **<kernelize>** is to **harvest all the concepts from a doc**:
- extract **each concept separately**
- reduce it to its **minimal viable form**
- treat kernels as **fertile seeds** for cataloging, briefing, or hosting in new docs.
