# 🧩 .brief.article: `librarian`

## .what
a **librarian** is the mechanism that **curates knowledge collections**: rather than authoring new documents, the librarian operates on existing ones, arranging them into coherent systems that make knowledge accessible and durable.

---

## 📑 scope of operation
- librarians do **not** usually instantiate documents themselves.
- instead, they **operate on documents**: selecting, classifying, preserving, and connecting them within a knowledge system.
- where authors **materialize concepts into documents**, librarians **materialize documents into collections**.

---

## 🔬 functions of a librarian
1. **selection** → deciding which documents belong in a collection.
2. **classification** → arranging documents into catalogs, indexes, and metadata systems.
3. **navigation** → providing guides, references, and pathways for discovery.
4. **preservation** → maintaining continuity of documents across time and formats.
5. **contextualization** → situating documents in relation to one another, weaving knowledge networks.

## 📌 examples

- **climate change:**
  authors produce an 📖 article (definition), a 🗂️ catalog (models), a 🎬 demo (regional case), and a 🎓 lesson (curriculum).
  the librarian curates them into a collection, classifies by type/domain, adds cross-references, and ensures long-term preservation.

- **philosophy:**
  authors produce an 📖 article (Metaphysics), a 🗂️ catalog (scholastic indexes), a 🎬 demo (Socratic dialogue), and a 🎓 lesson (curriculum).
  the librarian curates them into traditions, preserves across formats, and builds navigation systems (indexes, headings).

## ✨ insight
- **authors** materialize concepts into *documents*.
- **librarians** materialize documents into *collections*.
- mechanisms like **articulate, catalogize, demonstrate, lessonize** operate **within documents**.
- the **librarian** operates **between documents**, turning scattered works into a coherent knowledge ecology.
