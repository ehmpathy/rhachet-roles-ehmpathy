# 🧩 .brief.article: `<kernelize>`

## .what
`<kernelize>` is the mechanism of extracting **kernels** — compact, seed-like units of meaning — from a larger body of material. the source may be a conversation, article, report, dataset, or any other document. kernels are the minimal fertile units of knowledge: small enough to be portable, structured enough to be regrown.

---

## 🎯 purpose
- **compression** — reduce any document into its essential claims or data points.
- **seeding** — prepare minimal building blocks for future expansion or recomposition.
- **signal isolation** — identify what persists independent of narrative length, context, or form.

---

## ⚙️ process
1. **scan** — traverse the material for candidate kernels (facts, definitions, questions, patterns, lessons).
2. **isolate** — strip away supporting text, formatting, and narrative detail.
3. **reformulate** — encode kernels in a portable form, e.g. as propositions, labels, or structured notes.
4. **store** — maintain kernels as discrete, indexable units, ready for cataloging or recomposition.

---

## 🌱 properties
- **minimal** — only the irreducible unit of meaning remains.
- **fertile** — kernels can grow into expanded documents or frameworks later.
- **portable** — kernels stand alone, independent of original form.

## 📌 example
- **source:** a research article explaining climate change.
- **kernels:**
  - human activity increases greenhouse gases.
  - greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere.
  - global warming causes climate instability.

---

## 🔑 implications
- `<kernelize>` builds a **seed bank** across diverse sources.
- kernels become a universal currency for recomposition, cataloging, and abstraction.
- by kernelizing, knowledge remains both **compact** and **generative**.
