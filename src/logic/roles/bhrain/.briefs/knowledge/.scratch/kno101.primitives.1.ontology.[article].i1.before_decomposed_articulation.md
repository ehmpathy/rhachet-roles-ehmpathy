# 🧩 .brief.article: `knowledge ontology`

## 1. instances = atoms
- raw experiential data: single events, observations, specimens, measurements
- irreducible and concrete (“this fell,” “that person acted,” “this datum recorded”)

---

## 2. concepts = patterns in reality
- exist independently of human articulation or documents
- **real structures**: patterns, relationships, principles woven into the fabric of reality
- examples: gravity, leadership, erosion, cooperation
- “out there,” discoverable, whether or not anyone has yet documented them

---

## 3. documents = materialization vehicles
- do not create concepts, but **make them visible, graspable, transmissible**
- function: select, arrange, and frame instances to reveal the underlying concept
- archetypal treatments:
  - **article = definitional treatment** (clarify *what it is*)
  - **catalog = organizational treatment** (map *how it varies/relates*)
  - **demo = relational treatment** (show *how an instance exemplifies it*)
  - **lesson = pedagogical treatment** (guide *how to learn it*)

## 🔗 relationship

\`\`\`
concepts (real patterns in reality)
    ↓ revealed via
documents (organized arrangements)
    ↓ grounded in
instances (atoms of raw data)

## 📚 examples

### gravity
- **concept:** a real force/pattern in nature
- **documents:** Newton’s *Principia* organized planetary orbits + falling objects → made the concept transmissible
- **instances:** apples falling, moon’s orbit, tides

### leadership
- **concept:** a real relational pattern in human groups
- **documents:** biographies, management manuals, sociological studies → materialize the concept in different lights
- **instances:** specific leaders’ behaviors, group decisions, historical cases

## ✨ core insight
- **concepts are ontic** — they exist in the structure of reality.
- **documents are epistemic** — they reveal and transmit those concepts by arranging instances.
- **instances are evidentiary** — they are the atoms grounding the document’s materialization of the concept.

**documents are concept-detection and concept-transmission devices, not concept-creation devices.**
