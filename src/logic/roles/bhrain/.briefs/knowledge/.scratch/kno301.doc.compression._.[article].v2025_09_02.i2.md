# 🧩 .brief: `document variants along the compression axis`

## .what
documents can be understood along a **compression axis**, ranging from anemic labels to expansive forests.
this axis frames the **purpose** of each variant in relation to how concepts are materialized.

## 📊 compressed overview

| variant       | purpose | compression | concept span   | role |
|---------------|---------|-------------|----------------|------|
| 🔖 **ref**    | point   | anemic      | one            | handle into a concept (no content itself) |
| 🌱 **kernel** | seed    | atomic      | one            | minimal expression, fertile for growth |
| 🪴 **brief**  | carry   | compressed  | one or more    | self-contained, structured, and transferable |
| 🌳 **doc**    | host    | variable    | one or more    | full materialization at any scale |

## 🔬 variants

### 🔖 documents.refs
- **purpose:** point to a concept
- **concept span:** **one**
- **compression:** **anemic**; no content beyond the pointer
- **role:** handles or entry points into concepts

---

### 🌱 documents.kernels
- **purpose:** seed a concept
- **concept span:** **one**
- **compression:** **atomic**; smallest viable expression
- **role:** seeds for recomposition and growth

---

### 🪴 documents.briefs
- **purpose:** carry concepts
- **concept span:** **one or more**
- **compression:** **compressed**; maximally dense and structured
- **role:** portable gardens — transplant kernels into new soil to grow structured articulations

---

### 🌳 documents
- **purpose:** host concepts
- **concept span:** **one or more**
- **compression:** **variable**; can sprawl or condense
- **role:** general category of concept-materialization

---

## 📌 example: gravity

- 🔖 **ref:** the word *“gravity”* → points to **one** concept
- 🌱 **kernel:** `masses attract one another` → expresses **one** concept atomically
- 🪴 **brief:** a short structured explanation of gravitational attraction (may also reference inertia or force) → **one or more** concepts
- 🌳 **document:** Newton’s *Principia*, a system of mechanics covering gravity, motion, calculus, etc. → **one or more** concepts

---

## ✨ insight
- 🔖 **refs** = point → one concept, without content.
- 🌱 **kernels** = seed → one concept, minimally expressed but fertile.
- 🪴 **briefs** = carry → one or more concepts, compressed into portable pots.
- 🌳 **docs** = host → one or more concepts, expansive gardens/forests of any scale.
