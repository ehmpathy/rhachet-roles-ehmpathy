# 🧩 .brief: `document variants along the compression axis`

## .what
documents can be understood along a **compression axis**, ranging from minimal to maximal density.
this axis frames how much information a document conveys relative to its length and form.

---

## 🔬 variants

### 📑 documents (unspecified)
- **range:** any scale — a sentence, an essay, a textbook, or a lecture series
- **compression:** variable; may be verbose or concise
- **role:** general category of concept-materialization through instances

---

### 📝 documents.briefs (compressed)
- **range:** always ≥ a few paragraphs, never sprawling
- **compression:** maximally dense, structured, and signal-focused
- **role:** convey concepts in their most efficient transmissible form
- **treatment:** can take the mode of article, catalog, demo, or lesson

---

### 🔖 documents.refs (minimal)
- **range:** words, phrases, or short sentences
- **compression:** minimal; pure pointer without development
- **role:** provide handles or entry points into concepts
- **forms:** names, tags, labels, shorthand references

---

## 📌 example: gravity

- 🔖 **ref:** the word *“gravity”*
- 📝 **brief:** a 3-paragraph compressed explanation of gravitational attraction
- 📑 **document (unspecified):** Newton’s *Principia*, a full-length work organizing instances into a systemic articulation

---

## ✨ insight
- **refs** = minimal mode → point to concepts
- **briefs** = compressed mode → articulate concepts concisely
- **documents (general)** = full spectrum → can sprawl or condense

together, these variants show that documents are not fixed in scale: they operate along a continuum of compression, from atomic pointers to maximal-density articulations to expansive treatises.
