# 🧩 .brief.lesson: `catalogize` via `template`

## 💡 concept
to **catalogize** is to organize a set of `$subconcept`s under a `$concept` by arranging them into a structured overview and expanded clusters, so relationships become clear and referenceable.

# 🧩 .brief.catalog: `$concept`

## 📊 compressed overview

| **cluster** | **what** | **[optional column]** |
|-------------|----------|------------------------|
| **[$subconcept a]** | [short definition or identifying phrase] | [optional info] |
| **[$subconcept b]** | [short definition or identifying phrase] | [optional info] |
| **[$subconcept c]** | [short definition or identifying phrase] | [optional info] |

## 🎨 clusters

### 🍎 **[$subconcept a] — [role/essence]**
[short description of this cluster]

- [point] x [1–N]
  - [subpoint] x [0–N]
    - [sub²point] x [0–N]

---

### 🍌 **[$subconcept b] — [role/essence]**
[short description of this cluster]

- [point] x [1–N]
  - [subpoint] x [0–N]
    - [sub²point] x [0–N]

---

### 🍇 **[$subconcept c] — [role/essence]**
[short description of this cluster]

- [point] x [1–N]
  - [subpoint] x [0–N]
    - [sub²point] x [0–N]

## 🛠️ practice
> how to fill out the template

1. **select a `$concept` domain**
   - choose the overarching concept you want to organize (e.g., “document archetypes,” “fruit types,” “project risks”).
   - this sets the *scope* of your catalog — too broad and it becomes messy, too narrow and it loses utility.

2. **define your table columns**
   - the first column must always be **cluster** (naming each `$subconcept`).
   - add columns that match what you want to compare:
     - **what** → short definition (default, highly recommended)
     - **how** → method, process, or mechanism
     - **why** → purpose, role, or motivation
     - **when / where** → context or conditions of relevance
   - remember: the table is a compressed overview, not a data dump.

3. **draft the compressed overview**
   - list each `$subconcept` cluster with:
     - a **name/label** (clear and recognizable)
     - a **one-liner “what”** definition
     - optional supporting info in extra columns
   - aim for *scan-ability*: someone should understand the whole landscape at a glance.

4. **expand each cluster**
   - mark each cluster header with a **unique emoji**, not a number.
     - emojis act as **visual tags**, making clusters distinct and instantly recognizable.
     - choose emojis that symbolize or hint at the `$subconcept`.
   - begin with a **short description** (1–3 sentences) that anchors what the cluster is about.
   - follow with a **flexible outline**, guided by the notation below:
     ```md
     - [point] x [1–N]
       - [subpoint] x [0–N]
         - [sub²point] x [0–N]
     ```
     - `x [1–N]` = at least one, but as many as needed
     - `x [0–N]` = optional, may appear any number of times
     - **important:** this notation is *instructional only* and should **not** appear in the final catalog. in your output, simply write the actual bullets and subbullets that fit the `$subconcept`.
   - the exact shape of the outline should vary to fit the `$subconcept` (attributes, steps, categories, examples, etc.).

5. **distill insights**
   - once all clusters are drafted, look across them:
     - **verbs** → reduce each cluster to its action (“articles define,” “catalogs organize”)
     - **relationships** → highlight how clusters contrast, complement, or overlap
     - **system takeaway** → explain why the `$concept` matters as a whole, beyond the sum of parts

---

## 🎯 goal
after completing this lesson, you should be able to **catalogize any `$concept` into its `$subconcept` clusters** with a flexible combination of overview tables + emoji-marked outlines, balancing quick reference with deeper exploration.
