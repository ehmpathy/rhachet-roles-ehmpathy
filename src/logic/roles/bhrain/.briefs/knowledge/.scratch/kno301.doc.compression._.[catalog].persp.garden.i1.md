# ðŸ§© .brief.catalog: `doc types as gardens`

## ðŸ“Š compressed overview

| doc type         | garden type        | character                     | growth style            |
|------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **conversation** | wild plot           | untamed, fertile, messy        | spontaneous sprouts, weeds, mixed seeds |
| **book**         | orchard / forest    | expansive, long-term           | mature trees with interlinked roots |
| **brief**        | portable garden (pot) | compact, structured, self-contained | sprout-scale growth, transplantable |

## ðŸŽ¨ clusters

### ðŸŒ¾ **conversation = wild plot**
- unstructured, seeds scattered by chance.
- sprouts and weeds intermingle.
- kernels need to be harvested (kernelize) before reuse.

### ðŸŒ³ **book = orchard / forest**
- long-term conceptual growth.
- stalks and trees interlink, forming ecosystems.
- requires time and space to mature.

### ðŸª´ **brief = portable garden (pot)**
- structured but compact.
- kernels transplanted from other soil.
- sprouts cultivated in a way thatâ€™s easy to move, share, or repurpose.

## ðŸŒ¿ implications
- **docs are gardens of concepts** â€” some wild, some cultivated, some portable, some expansive.
- **briefs are pots** â€” portable gardens designed for structure and clarity.
- **conversations** scatter kernels wildly; **articles** tend them; **books** mature them; **briefs** transplant them.
