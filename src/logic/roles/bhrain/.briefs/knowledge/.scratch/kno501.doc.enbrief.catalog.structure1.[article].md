# 🧩 .brief.article: `catalog.structure.s1`

## 💡 what
**structure.s1** is a **common structure for a catalog**: it organizes a `$concept` into a set of `$subconcept` clusters, balancing a compressed overview with detailed expansions. while other structures are possible, this pattern appears frequently because it provides both scan-ability and depth.

---

## 🧱 core structure

### 1. **compressed overview (table)**
- **purpose:** provide a **scannable map** of the `$concept` space
- **format:** a table whose **first column is always cluster** (naming each `$subconcept`)
- **columns:** flexible, but commonly include **what** (definition) plus optional dimensions like *how*, *why*, *when*, or *where*
- **role:** gives readers a **quick grasp** of the full landscape

---

### 2. **clusters (expanded sections)**
- **purpose:** deepen understanding of each `$subconcept`
- **format:** a section per cluster, consisting of:
  1. **emoji-marked header** — each cluster begins with a **distinct emoji**, not a number, to serve as a visual marker that makes clusters easy to grok at a glance
  2. **short description** — 1–3 sentences that summarize the cluster’s essence
  3. **flexible outline** — a variable nested outline that adapts to the topic. its *notation* is:
     ```md
     - [point] x [1–N]
       - [subpoint] x [0–N]
         - [sub²point] x [0–N]
     ```
     - `x [1–N]` = at least one, but as many as needed
     - `x [0–N]` = optional, may appear as many as needed
     - **important:** this notation is **guidance only** — it should *not* appear in the final catalog. in actual use, simply write bullets/subbullets as relevant, without the `[1–N]` markers.
     - the outline’s *shape* should vary to fit the `$subconcept` (attributes, steps, categories, examples, etc.)
- **role:** creates **depth and variation**, allowing each cluster to be expressed in the form that best fits its content

---

### 3. **insight (synthesis)**
- **purpose:** extract patterns across clusters
- **methods:**
  - reduce clusters into **verbs** (e.g., “articles define,” “catalogs organize”)
  - highlight **relationships** (complements, contrasts, overlaps)
  - summarize the **system-level takeaway** (why the catalog matters as a whole)
- **role:** turns the catalog into more than a list — a **lens for understanding** the `$concept`

---

## ✨ key properties
- **overview + depth** → balances a **table for scanning** with **clusters for exploration**
- **emoji headers** → clusters are introduced with **visual emoji markers** instead of numbers, supporting instant recognition and variety without implying sequence
- **flexible outline** → clusters expand into a bullet/subbullet hierarchy; the `[1–N]` notation is *instructional only* and not included in the final output
- **insight-oriented** → not a static inventory but an interpretive map that clarifies relationships and value

---

## 🧩 summary
**structure.s1** is a **common structure for a catalog**:
1. a **compressed overview** table to map the terrain,
2. a set of **emoji-marked clusters** with short descriptions + flexible outlines (bullets/subbullets as relevant, without notation),
3. an **insight section** that synthesizes meaning.

it is widely useful because it supports both **quick reference** and **conceptual exploration**, making `$concept` domains easier to navigate.
