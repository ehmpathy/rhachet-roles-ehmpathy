# ðŸ§© .brief.demo: `kernel vs ref vs brief vs doc` via `metaphor=garden`

## ðŸŒ± metaphor translation

- **doc = garden**
  any conceptual ground where seeds (kernels) may be planted.
  can be wild (conversation), cultivated (article), or expansive (book).
  hosts growth at all scales: sprouts, stalks, trees.

- **brief = portable garden (plant pot)**
  a doc subtype: a structured, self-contained garden made for portability.
  kernels are transplanted here to grow into compact, structured forms.

- **kernel = seed**
  atomic, fertile unit â€” smallest carrier of a concept with growth potential.

- **ref = label**
  markers tied to seeds or plants â€” enable indexing and navigation across gardens.

## ðŸŒ¿ growth ladder in the garden

- **seed = kernel**
- **sprout = kernel grown in a brief (pot)**
- **stalk = mid-scale doc growth**
- **tree = mature doc growth**

## ðŸ”„ garden cycle (portable vs general)

\`\`\`
(general garden: doc) â—„â”€â”€ kernels (seeds) â”€â”€â–º (portable garden: brief)
       â”‚                                        â”‚
       â”‚                                        â–¼
   sprouts / stalks / trees             sprout-scale structured growth
       â”‚
       â–¼
(labels: refs) index plants, plots, and pots
\`\`\`

## ðŸŒ¿ implications
- **docs** are **gardens**: any soil where concepts can take root and scale.
- **briefs** are **portable gardens**: pots designed to host transplanted kernels and grow them in compact, structured ways.
- **kernels** are **seeds**: portable units of conceptual fertility.
- **refs** are **labels**: the garden tags that track, identify, and organize growth.
