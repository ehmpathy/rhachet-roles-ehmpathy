# 🧩 .brief.article: `librarian` as `curator`

## 📑 scope of operation
- librarians do **not** usually instantiate documents themselves.
- instead, they **operate on documents**: selecting, arranging, cataloging, and connecting them within a knowledge system.
- where authors “materialize concepts into documents,” librarians “materialize collections into knowledge ecologies.”

---

## 🔬 functions of a librarian
1. **selection** → deciding which documents belong in a collection.
2. **classification** → arranging documents into catalogs, indexes, and metadata systems.
3. **navigation** → building interfaces (catalogs, guides, references) that connect users to the right document form.
4. **preservation** → ensuring documents persist across time (archiving, digitization).
5. **contextualization** → situating documents in relation to each other, building knowledge networks.

## 📌 example
- a researcher authors a 📖 *document.article* defining “climate change.”
- another researcher authors a 🗂️ *document.catalog* of climate models.
- a field worker authors a 🎬 *document.demo* (case study of one region).
- an educator authors a 🎓 *document.lesson* (curriculum for high school students).

the **librarian**:
- selects these documents into the climate knowledge collection.
- catalogizes them by type, author, domain, and date.
- provides references and cross-links for navigation.
- ensures the whole is accessible, coherent, and durable.

## ✨ insight
- **authors** materialize concepts into *documents*.
- **librarians** curate those documents into *systems of knowledge*.
- in this sense:
  - mechanisms like *articulate, catalogize, demonstrate, lessonize* operate **within documents**.
  - the librarian’s work operates **between documents**, weaving them into a usable knowledge ecology.
