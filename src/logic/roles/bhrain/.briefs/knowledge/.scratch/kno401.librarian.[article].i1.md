# 🧩 .brief.article: `librarian`

## .what
a **librarian** is the mechanism that **curates knowledge collections**: rather than authoring new documents, the librarian operates on existing ones, arranging them into coherent systems that make knowledge accessible and durable.

---

## 📑 scope of operation
- librarians do **not** usually instantiate documents themselves.
- instead, they **operate on documents**: selecting, classifying, preserving, and connecting them within a knowledge system.
- where authors **materialize concepts into documents**, librarians **materialize documents into collections**.

---

## 🔬 functions of a librarian
1. **selection** → deciding which documents belong in a collection.
2. **classification** → arranging documents into catalogs, indexes, and metadata systems.
3. **navigation** → providing guides, references, and pathways for discovery.
4. **preservation** → maintaining continuity of documents across time and formats.
5. **contextualization** → situating documents in relation to one another, weaving knowledge networks.

## 📌 example

### 🌍 climate change
- a researcher authors a 📖 *document.article* defining “climate change.”
- another researcher authors a 🗂️ *document.catalog* of climate models.
- a field worker authors a 🎬 *document.demo* (case study of one region).
- an educator authors a 🎓 *document.lesson* (curriculum for high school students).

the **librarian**:
- selects these documents into the climate knowledge collection.
- catalogizes them by type, author, domain, and date.
- provides references and cross-links for navigation.
- ensures the whole is accessible, coherent, and durable.

### 📚 philosophy
- a philosopher authors a 📖 *document.article* defining “being” (*Metaphysics*).
- scholastics compile a 🗂️ *document.catalog* organizing classical texts.
- Plato authors a 🎬 *document.demo* (Socratic dialogue showing reasoning in action).
- educators design a 🎓 *document.lesson* (curriculum on ethics or epistemology).

the **librarian**:
- selects these works into philosophical collections.
- classifies them by school, period, and theme.
- preserves them across manuscripts, print, and digital forms.
- creates systems (indexes, subject headings) for navigation.

## ✨ insight
- **authors** materialize concepts into *documents*.
- **librarians** materialize documents into *collections*.
- mechanisms like **articulate, catalogize, demonstrate, lessonize** operate **within documents**.
- the **librarian** operates **between documents**, turning scattered works into a coherent knowledge ecology.
