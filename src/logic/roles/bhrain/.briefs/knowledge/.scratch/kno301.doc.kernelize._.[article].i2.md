# 🧩 .brief.article: `<kernelize>`

## .what
**<kernelize>** is the mechanism that extracts 🌱 **doc.kernels** from a 📚 **doc**.
it reduces unstructured or expansive material into **atomic expressions**, each carrying **one concept**.

---

## 🎯 purpose
- **distill**: strip away noise, phrasing, and redundancy
- **stabilize**: preserve the integrity of a concept in its minimal viable form
- **prepare**: produce fertile, portable units for reuse in 🪴 briefs, 🔖 refs, or new 📚 docs

---

## ⚙️ process
1. **scan** a doc for conceptual content
2. **isolate** discrete ideas (facts, claims, questions, patterns)
3. **reduce** each to its irreducible expression, removing surplus words/context
4. **declare** the result as a 🌱 **doc.kernel**

---

## 🔄 relation to other mechanisms
- **<catalogize>** → indexes kernels by producing 🔖 **doc.refs**
- **<brief>** → transplants kernels into 🪴 **doc.briefs**, structured for portability
- **<document>** → hosts kernels at any scale inside 📚 docs

## 📌 examples

### ⚖️ gravity (from a lecture transcript)
> *“so, basically, the reason the apple falls is because earth pulls on it with a force — and actually, any two masses in the universe attract each other, that’s Newton’s big insight.”*
→ 🌱 **doc.kernel:** `masses attract one another`

---

### 🎵 music (from a conversation)
> *“you know, when you line up sounds in rhythm and melody, suddenly it feels like music instead of just noise.”*
→ 🌱 **doc.kernel:** `organized sound creates aesthetic or emotional experience`

---

### 🧩 triangle (from a textbook chapter)
> *“a triangle is defined as a polygon with three sides, three angles, and the sum of its angles equal to 180° in Euclidean space.”*
→ 🌱 **doc.kernel:** `a triangle has three sides`

---

## ✨ insight
- **<kernelize>** is the **harvest step**: pulling out the fertile seeds from the soil of a doc.
- 🌱 **doc.kernels** are then available to be **indexed** (🔖 refs), **structured** (🪴 briefs), or **cultivated** (📚 docs).
- without **<kernelize>**, concepts remain entangled in unstructured soil; with it, they become **atomic carriers of meaning**.
