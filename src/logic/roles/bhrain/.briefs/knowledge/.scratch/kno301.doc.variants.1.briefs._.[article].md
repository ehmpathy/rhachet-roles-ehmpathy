# 🧩 .brief: `briefs as compressed documents`

## .what
**documents** can take any length or scale — from a single sentence to a multi-volume lecture.
**briefs** are a specialized slice of documents: they guarantee **at least a few paragraphs**, with **maximal compression** of signal into the smallest viable space.

## 🔬 characteristics

### documents (📑)
- **scale-flexible** → may be a sentence, an essay, or an entire textbook
- **treatment-flexible** → can take the form of article, catalog, demo, lesson
- **quality-variable** → may be verbose, noisy, or diffuse

### briefs (📝)
- **compression-mandated** → maximum signal, minimum noise
- **length-anchored** → not too short (≥ a few paragraphs), not sprawling
- **treatment-flexible** → can adopt any document archetype (article, catalog, demo, lesson)
- **clarity-focused** → structured, high-density articulation of the concept

## 📌 example
- 📑 *document.article*: a 30-page research paper on **leadership**
- 📝 *brief.article*: a 3-paragraph compressed articulation of **leadership**

## ✨ insight
- all **briefs are documents**, but not all **documents are briefs**
- documents vary widely in scale and density, while briefs **guarantee structured concision**
- briefs are thus the **high-efficiency mode** of documentation — ensuring concepts are always materialized in a form that is short, structured, and maximally informative.
