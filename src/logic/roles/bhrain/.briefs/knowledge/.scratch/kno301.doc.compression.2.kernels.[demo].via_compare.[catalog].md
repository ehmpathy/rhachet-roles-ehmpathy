# 🧩 .brief.catalog: `kernel vs ref vs brief vs doc`

## 📊 compressed overview

| unit      | what it is                                           | scope           | portability | fertility |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| **ref**    | pointer to a concept (title, tag, shorthand)        | tiny            | high        | medium    |
| **kernel** | atomic seed of a concept (fact, claim, que, etc...) | irreducible     | highest     | highest   |
| **brief**  | structured materialization of one or more concepts  | compact doc     | medium      | high      |
| **doc**    | materialization of one or more concepts             | full range      | varies      | variable  |

## 🎨 clusters

### 🏷️ **ref**
- pointer to a concept
- role: index into kernels, briefs, or docs

### 🌱 **kernel**
- atomic unit of a concept
- role: seed for recomposition

### 📄 **brief**
- structured materialization of concepts
- forms: article, demo, lesson, catalog, vision, etc.
- role: impose structure to clarify, compare, or teach concepts

### 📚 **doc**
- general materialization of concepts
- may be raw (conversation), narrative (report), or structured (brief)
- role: container of concepts, in any form

---

## 🔑 implications
- **doc** = any materialization of concepts.
- **brief** = a **structured doc**; all briefs are docs, not all docs are briefs.
- **kernel** = the **seed**: smallest portable expression of a concept.
- **ref** = a **pointer** to concepts, independent of form.
