# 🧩 .brief.catalog: `recursion in documents`

## .what
because all documents are **instances of type**, they can serve as **input instances** for new documents.
this recursive property explains how knowledge systems accumulate: documents continually materialize concepts while drawing on prior documents as their raw material.

---

## 📖 articles using documents
- **citing:** reference prior articles as evidence or context.
- **synthesizing:** weave multiple documents into a new definitional treatment.
- **example:** a meta-article on “democracy” cites historical articles, demos, and lessons to define its evolution.

---

## 🗂️ catalogs using documents
- **aggregating:** group documents of the same type into taxonomies or lists.
- **indexing:** organize articles, demos, or lessons by topic, date, or author.
- **example:** a catalog of teaching curricula (lessons) across universities.

---

## 🎬 demos using documents
- **showcasing:** use an article, lesson, or catalog as the instance that exemplifies a concept.
- **contextualizing:** demonstrate how a specific document embodies or reveals a broader principle.
- **example:** a demo showing how Newton’s *Principia* itself demonstrates the process of scientific articulation.

---

## 🎓 lessons using documents
- **sequencing:** structure lessons around prior articles, demos, or catalogs.
- **teaching through documents:** use preserved works as practice material.
- **example:** a philosophy curriculum built from Plato’s dialogues (demos), Aristotle’s categories (catalog), and modern articles.

---

## ✨ insight
- 📖 **articles cite** other documents to refine definitions.
- 🗂️ **catalogs aggregate** documents into organized systems.
- 🎬 **demos showcase** documents as exemplars.
- 🎓 **lessons sequence** documents into pathways of learning.

recursion in documents ensures that knowledge is **layered, cumulative, and evolving**:
documents are never isolated — they both **draw from** and **become** instances for new documents in the ongoing materialization of concepts.
