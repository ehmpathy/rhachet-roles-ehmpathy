# 🧩 documents.demo (relational treatment)

## .what
a **demo** is a document form that provides a **relational treatment** of a concept.
its role is to **show how a particular instance exemplifies a concept**, making the abstract tangible through lived or observable cases.

demos do not create the concept — they **materialize it** by spotlighting the link between instance and concept.

## 🔬 characteristics
- **exemplificatory** → highlights “this is how *that* shows *this*”
- **concrete** → rooted in specific cases, narratives, or simulations
- **relational** → frames the connection between instance and concept
- **illustrative** → emphasizes visibility and graspability over abstraction

## 🧷 forms of demos
> note: these clusters are not exhaustive, but demonstrative

- **case studies** → detailed instances exemplifying a concept in practice
- **simulations** → modeled scenarios demonstrating principles
- **narratives** → stories or dialogues that embody concepts
- **worked examples** → step-by-step demonstrations of how a concept applies
- **videos / performances** → live or recorded enactments of concepts in action

## 📌 examples
- Portland as a demo of **walkability**
- the Ferrari F1-75 as a demo of a **racecar**
- a clinical case study as a demo of **disease presentation**
- a worked math example as a demo of **algebraic principles**
- a role-play video as a demo of **conflict resolution**

## ✨ role
- **reveal** → make abstract concepts perceivable through concrete exemplars
- **bridge** → connect the rawness of instances with the abstraction of concepts
- **transmit** → enable intuitive grasp by showing, not just telling
