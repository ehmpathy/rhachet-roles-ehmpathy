# ðŸ§© .brief: `instances, documents, concepts`

## .what
knowledge rests on three interdependent layers:
- **instances** (atoms of data/experience)
- **documents** (materializations built on instances)
- **concepts** (patterns/relationships in reality)

---

## ðŸ”¬ structure

### 1. instances = atoms
- the irreducible substrate: data, events, cases, specimens
- raw, concrete, concept-neutral until organized

### 2. documents = materializations
- organized arrangements of instances that **make concepts visible**
- treatments:
  - **article = definitional**
  - **catalog = organizational**
  - **demo = relational**
  - **lesson = pedagogical**

### 3. concepts = patterns in reality
- abstract structures that exist independent of documentation
- revealed, not created, by documents
- persist across contexts, even if differently expressed

## ðŸ”— relationship

\`\`\`
concepts (patterns in reality)
    â†“ materialized via
documents (organized arrangements of instances)
    â†“ grounded in
instances (atoms of raw data/experience)
\`\`\`

## ðŸ“Œ examples

- **gravity**
  - concept: a real principle of nature
  - documents: Newtonâ€™s *Principia* (article/lesson)
  - instances: apples falling, orbits, tides

- **leadership**
  - concept: a relational pattern in human groups
  - documents: biographies, case studies, management guides
  - instances: specific leader actions, group decisions

---

## âœ¨ insight
- **instances** = evidentiary base
- **documents** = concept-detection and transmission devices
- **concepts** = pre-existing patterns that documents reveal

knowledge emerges in practice not because concepts are invented, but because documents **make them perceptible** by arranging instances.
