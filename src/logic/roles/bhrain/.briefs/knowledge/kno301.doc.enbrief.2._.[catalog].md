# 🧩 .brief.catalog: `mechanisms of document instantiation`

## .what
each document archetype (📖 article, 🗂️ catalog, 🎬 demo, 🎓 lesson) corresponds to a **mechanism** that materializes a concept in that form.
this catalog organizes the four mechanisms — **articulate, catalogize, demonstrate, lessonize** — showing how they function in parallel.

---

## 📖 articulate → articles (definitional treatment)
- **mechanism:** materializes a concept *as* an article
- **function:** defines the concept, sets boundaries, clarifies meaning
- **example:** articulating “symmetry” by defining invariance under transformations and relating with butterfly wings, squares, and musical phrases

---

## 🗂️ catalogize → catalogs (organizational treatment)
- **mechanism:** materializes a concept *as* a catalog
- **function:** organizes instances into groups, categories, or dimensions
- **example:** catalogizing “memory” into short-term vs long-term, then declarative vs procedural

---

## 🎬 demonstrate → demos (relational treatment)
- **mechanism:** materializes a concept *as* a demo
- **function:** shows how an instance exemplifies the concept, bridging abstract and concrete
- **example:** demonstrating “walkability” by relating the city of Portland’s sidewalks, mixed-use zoning, and transit integration to the broader concept

---

## 🎓 lessonize → lessons (pedagogical treatment)
- **mechanism:** materializes a concept *as* a lesson
- **function:** builds a scaffolded progression of steps and practices for learning
- **example:** lessonizing “gravity” into a sequence: dropping an apple → comparing orbits → stating Newton’s law → practicing with tides

---

## ✨ insight
- 📖 **articulate** defines concepts
- 🗂️ **catalogize** organizes concepts
- 🎬 **demonstrate** exemplifies concepts
- 🎓 **lessonize** teaches concepts

together, these mechanisms form the **system of document instantiation**: four complementary ways to materialize concepts by arranging instances into communicable form.
