# 🧩 .brief.demo: `brief archetypes` via `gravity`

## .what
the same set of **instances** (🔹 falling apple, 🌙 moon’s orbit, 🌊 ocean tides) can be compressed into different **brief archetypes**.
each archetype demonstrates the concept of **gravity** through a distinct treatment: definitional, organizational, relational, or pedagogical.

---

## 📖 brief.article — definitional
**treatment:** clarify *what gravity is*
**content:**
- defines gravity as the universal attraction between masses
- relates with the apple falling and the moon orbiting
- explains its significance for physics and daily life

---

## 🗂️ brief.catalog — organizational
**treatment:** map *how gravity manifests across cases*
**content:**
- terrestrial gravity (apple falling, objects pulled to Earth)
- celestial gravity (moon orbit, planetary motion)
- tidal gravity (ocean tides pulled by the moon)
- relates these diverse phenomena under one principle

---

## 🎬 brief.demo — relational
**treatment:** show *how one instance exemplifies gravity*
**content:**
- takes the falling apple as the focal instance
- relates it to the same force governing planetary orbits
- bridges the link between a simple case and a universal concept

---

## 🎓 brief.lesson — pedagogical
**treatment:** guide *how to learn gravity step by step*
**content:**
1. observe a dropped apple (instance of falling objects)
2. compare to the moon’s orbit (celestial instance)
3. connect both to Newton’s principle of universal gravitation
4. practice with examples (why we stay grounded, why tides shift)
- relates concrete cases to the abstract principle

---

## ✨ insight
- 📖 **article** defines
- 🗂️ **catalog** organizes
- 🎬 **demo** exemplifies
- 🎓 **lesson** teaches

all four compress instances into different treatments — each **relating gravity** in a way tailored to definition, organization, exemplification, or pedagogy.
