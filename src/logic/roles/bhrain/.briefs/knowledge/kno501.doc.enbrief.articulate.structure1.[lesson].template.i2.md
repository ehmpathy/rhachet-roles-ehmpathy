# 🧩 .brief.lesson: `articulate` via `template.structure.1`

## 💡 what
this lesson shows how to use **`template.structure.1`** to articulate a concept into an article.
it is one of many possible article structures, but one we use often for its balance of definition, examples, context, and insight.

---

## 🎓 steps

1. **anchor with `.what`**
   - begin with a one-sentence essence of the `$concept`.
   - this locks scope and is always required.

2. **select supporting sections**
   - add sections that strengthen clarity:
     - **definition** → spell out boundaries, mechanism, distinctions
     - **instances** → ground with 1–3 representative examples
     - **context** → situate in domain, history, or contrasts
     - **insight** → synthesize significance or implications

3. **compose**
   - write in lowercase (except proper nouns).
   - favor concise lists and short paragraphs.
   - maximize signal; cut filler.

4. **refine**
   - check clarity and completeness.
   - ensure the article works as a definitional treatment.
