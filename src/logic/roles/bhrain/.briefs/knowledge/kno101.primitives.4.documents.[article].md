# ðŸ§© documents (concept materializations)

## .what
**documents** are structured arrangements of instances that **materialize a concept** â€” making it visible, graspable, and transmissible.

They do not create concepts, but reveal and communicate them by curating how instances are selected, ordered, and framed.

---

## ðŸ”¬ characteristics
- **constructive** â†’ transform raw instances into recognizable patterns
- **mediating** â†’ bridge between abstract concept and concrete instances
- **varied** â†’ different treatments (definitional, organizational, relational, pedagogical)
- **persistent** â†’ stabilize knowledge so it can be shared across time and space

---

## ðŸ§· forms of documents
- **articles** â†’ definitional treatment (what a concept *is*)
- **catalogs** â†’ organizational treatment (how it *varies/relates*)
- **demos** â†’ relational treatment (how an *instance exemplifies* it)
- **lessons** â†’ pedagogical treatment (how it can be *learned*)

---

## ðŸ“Œ examples
- *Principia Mathematica* (article/lesson) materializing the concept of **gravity**
- a biological taxonomy chart (catalog) materializing the concept of **species differentiation**
- a video case study (demo) materializing the concept of **leadership in practice**
- a tutorial sequence (lesson) materializing the concept of **computer programming**

---

## âœ¨ role
- **materializers:** reveal pre-existing concepts through organization of instances
- **detectors:** detect patterns implicit in reality by framing evidence
- **transmitters:** make concepts communicable across audiences and generations
