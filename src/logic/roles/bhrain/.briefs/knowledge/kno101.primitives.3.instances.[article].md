# ðŸ§© instances (atoms)

## .what
**instances** are the irreducible substrate of knowledge â€” the raw, concrete elements of experience, observation, or data.

They are the *things themselves*, not yet arranged or interpreted.

---

## ðŸ”¬ characteristics
- **atomic** â†’ cannot be further reduced without losing identity
- **concrete** â†’ tied to specific time, place, or occurrence
- **neutral** â†’ not bound to any single concept until organized in a document
- **repeatable** â†’ can be referenced, collected, or measured

---

## ðŸ§· forms of instances
- **data points** â†’ a recorded temperature, a survey response, a transaction
- **events** â†’ a protest, a business meeting, a thunderstorm
- **cases** â†’ an individual patientâ€™s condition, a lawsuit, a project outcome
- **specimens** â†’ a biological sample, a rock in geology, an artifact in archaeology

> note: these clusters are not exhaustive, but demonstrative

## ðŸ“Œ examples
- a single apple falling from a tree (event)
- one lab measurement of blood pressure (data point)
- a specific court ruling (case)
- a fossil in a museum drawer (specimen)

## âœ¨ role
- **foundation:** supply the evidentiary grounding for all knowledge work
- **versatility:** the same set of instances can underlie multiple concepts, depending on arrangement
- **dependency:** without instances, documents cannot materialize concepts
