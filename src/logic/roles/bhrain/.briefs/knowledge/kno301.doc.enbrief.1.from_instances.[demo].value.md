# 🧩 .brief.demo: `brief archetypes via value`

## .what
the same set of **instances** (💵 a product’s price tag, ❤️ choosing family over work, ⚖️ a debate on justice) can be compressed into different **brief archetypes**.
this demo shows how the concept of **value** is materialized differently depending on the treatment: definitional, organizational, relational, or pedagogical.

---

## 📖 brief.article — definitional
**treatment:** clarify *what value is*
**content:**
- defines value as the measure of worth or importance attributed to something
- relates with the instances of a price tag on goods and the prioritization of relationships
- explains how value operates across economic, ethical, and personal domains

---

## 🗂️ brief.catalog — organizational
**treatment:** map *how value manifests across cases*
**content:**
- **economic value** → exchange worth (price of a good)
- **moral value** → ethical priority (justice, fairness)
- **personal value** → subjective importance (family, love, passion)
- relates these as distinct yet overlapping forms of the concept of value

---

## 🎬 brief.demo — relational
**treatment:** show *how one instance exemplifies value*
**content:**
- takes the example of choosing family over work
- relates this decision to the broader concept of personal value
- bridges the specific case to the general principle that humans assign worth beyond money

---

## 🎓 brief.lesson — pedagogical
**treatment:** guide *how to learn value step by step*
**content:**
1. examine a product’s price as an instance of economic value
2. compare it with moral debates (justice vs expedience)
3. reflect on personal decisions (time with loved ones vs career ambition)
4. connect these examples to the general principle that “value” is the attribution of worth across domains
- relates concrete experiences to the abstract principle of value

---

## ✨ insight
- 📖 **article** defines value as worth
- 🗂️ **catalog** organizes its types
- 🎬 **demo** exemplifies value in a single case
- 🎓 **lesson** teaches value as a learnable, multi-domain concept

this demo shows how a contested and multifaceted concept like **value** can still be materialized through brief archetypes, each relating the same set of instances in a distinct way.
