# 🧩 .brief.lesson: `how to demonstrate a demo`

## .what
a **demo** is a document that gives a **relational treatment** of a concept: it shows *how an instance exemplifies a concept*.
this lesson explains how to **demonstrate a demo** — i.e., how to instantiate a demo so the connection between instance and concept is maximally clear.

## 🎓 steps

1. **select the concept**
   - identify the abstraction you want to materialize (e.g., “resilience”).

2. **choose a focal instance**
   - pick a concrete, vivid case (e.g., a tree bending in strong wind).
   - ensure it is representative enough to reveal the concept.

3. **frame the relation**
   - state directly how the instance demonstrates the concept.
   - highlight the relational link (instance → concept).

4. **situate in context**
   - explain why this instance is a strong example.
   - connect to broader relevance (domain, application, meaning).

5. **compress articulation**
   - keep it concise: usually 2–3 paragraphs.
   - remove noise, emphasize clarity of the instance–concept link.

## 📌 example: demonstrating a demo of “resilience”

- **concept:** resilience
- **instance:** a tree bending in strong wind
- **relation:** the bending tree demonstrates resilience by showing flexibility under force without breaking.
- **context:** this everyday natural instance captures the broader human/social concept of adapting to stress.
- **compression:** two short paragraphs clearly tying instance → concept.

## ✨ insight
to demonstrate a demo:
- pick a **clear instance**
- articulate its **relation to the concept**
- situate it in **context**
- keep the link **compressed and clear**

a demo succeeds when the audience can see the **abstract concept made visible** through a single, well-chosen instance.
