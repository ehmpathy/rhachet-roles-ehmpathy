# 🧩 .brief.demo: `brief archetypes via algorithm`

## .what
the same set of **instances** (🔢 sorting a list, 🗺️ shortest-path on a map, 📐 euclid’s gcd) can be compressed into different **brief archetypes**.
this demo shows how the concept of an **algorithm** is materialized differently depending on the treatment: definitional, organizational, relational, or pedagogical.

---

## 📖 brief.article — definitional
**treatment:** clarify *what an algorithm is*
**content:**
- defines an algorithm as a **finite, effective procedure** that transforms inputs to outputs via well-specified steps
- relates with sorting a list (input→ordered output) and navigating a shortest path (start→goal)
- explains key properties: correctness, termination, complexity, and determinism/probabilism

---

## 🗂️ brief.catalog — organizational
**treatment:** map *how algorithms vary*
**content:**
- **paradigms:** divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking
- **guarantees:** exact vs approximate; deterministic vs randomized
- **models/costs:** time vs space complexity; online vs offline
- relates these facets as dimensions for classifying algorithms

---

## 🎬 brief.demo — relational
**treatment:** show *how one instance exemplifies the concept*
**content:**
- takes **euclid’s algorithm** for gcd(a, b) as the focal instance
- relates the step rule `gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b)` until `b = 0` → output `a`
- bridges concreteness (repeated remainder) to general qualities: termination, correctness proof, complexity `O(log min(a,b))`

---

## 🎓 brief.lesson — pedagogical
**treatment:** guide *how to learn algorithms step by step*
**content:**
1. start with a recipe-like task (sort 5 numbers by hand) and write the steps
2. trace pseudocode for selection sort; count comparisons/swaps
3. compare with merge sort; discuss divide-and-conquer idea
4. apply to a pathfinding task (sketch dijkstra on a tiny graph)
- relates concrete traces to abstractions (invariants, correctness, big-O)

---

## ✨ insight
- 📖 **article** defines the essence (finite, effective, specified steps)
- 🗂️ **catalog** organizes paradigms, guarantees, and cost models
- 🎬 **demo** exemplifies via a single concrete algorithm (euclid)
- 🎓 **lesson** teaches the craft through tracing, proofs, and analysis

this demo shows how **algorithms**—though formal and abstract—are materialized through brief archetypes, each relating shared instances in a distinct way.
