# 🧩 .brief: `documents.refs (minimal references)`

## .what
**refs** are a type of document at the most minimal scale.
they function as **direct pointers to concepts** — often just a word, phrase, or short sentence.
unlike longer documents, they do not develop, explain, or organize; they simply **reference**.

---

## 🔬 characteristics
- **minimal** → the smallest possible form of a document
- **indexical** → serve to point toward a concept without elaboration
- **atomic** → can be embedded within larger documents as building blocks
- **dependent** → rely on context (shared language, prior knowledge) to be meaningful

---

## 🧷 forms of refs
> note: not exhaustive, but demonstrative

- **single words** → “gravity,” “justice,” “walkability”
- **short phrases** → “social contract,” “supply and demand”
- **sentence-pointers** → “see Newton on planetary motion,” “refer to Portland as an example”
- **labels / tags** → category names, hashtags, keywords

---

## 📌 examples
- the term **“photosynthesis”** pointing to the concept of energy conversion in plants
- the word **“democracy”** referencing the concept of collective governance
- a tag like **#leadership** indexing content about the social concept of leadership
- a margin note: *“cf. Euclid, Book I”*

---

## ✨ role
- **name** → provide handles for concepts so they can be referenced in discourse
- **index** → act as entry points into larger bodies of knowledge
- **embed** → function as the basic building blocks within more expansive documents

refs are thus the **minimal mode of documents**: pure reference without expansion, anchoring the link between language and concepts.
