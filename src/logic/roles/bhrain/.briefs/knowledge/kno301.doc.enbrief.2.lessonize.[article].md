# 🧩 .brief.article: `lessonize`

## .what
**lessonize** is the mechanism that **instantiates lessons**: it materializes a concept as a structured pedagogical treatment that guides learning.

---

## 🔬 definition
- **mechanism:** the materialization of a concept into lesson form.
- **function:** provides a scaffolded sequence of steps, examples, and practices so the learner can internalize the concept.
- **distinction:** articulation describes *what a lesson is*; lessonizing performs the *instantiation* of a lesson.

---

## 📌 examples
- to lessonize “gravity,” one designs a sequence moving from dropping an apple → comparing planetary orbits → explaining Newton’s law → practicing with tidal predictions.
- to lessonize “empathy,” one builds a progression from observing a friend’s feelings → practicing perspective-taking → responding → reflecting on the effect.

---

## ✨ insight
**lessonize** is the bridge between concept and pedagogy:
- it is the **mechanism** of turning raw content into structured learning.
- it ensures that lessons are not improvised but **instantiated systematically**.

in knowledge architecture, lessonize sits alongside other mechanisms (e.g., *articulate, catalogize, demonstrate*) as a specific process for **pedagogical materialization**.
