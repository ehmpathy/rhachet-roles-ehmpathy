# 🧩 .brief: `instances, documents, concepts as observations, references, referents`

## .what
knowledge can be framed as a triad of **observations, references, and referents**:
- 🔹 **instances = observations**
- 📑 **documents = references**
- 🌐 **concepts = referents**

this alignment highlights how knowledge flows: from what is observed, to how it is referenced, to what those references ultimately point to in reality.

## 🔬 structure

### 🔹 instances = observations
- raw particulars: data points, events, cases, specimens
- directly perceived or recorded
- evidentiary substrate for knowledge

### 📑 documents = references
- organized forms that point to and frame observations
- articles, catalogs, demos, lessons
- mediate between what is observed and what is real by structuring references

### 🌐 concepts = referents
- real patterns, structures, or principles in reality
- exist independently of observation or documentation
- what references (documents) ultimately point toward

---

## 📌 example: gravity

- **observations (instances):** apples falling, planets orbiting, tides shifting
- **references (documents):** Newton’s *Principia*, astronomical tables, physics lessons
- **referent (concept):** the real force/pattern of gravitational attraction

---

## ✨ insight
- 🔹 **observations** give us the data of experience
- 📑 **references** organize those observations for transmission
- 🌐 **referents** are the real-world structures those references aim at

documents are thus **structured references**: they do not create concepts but link observations to the pre-existing referents those observations disclose.
