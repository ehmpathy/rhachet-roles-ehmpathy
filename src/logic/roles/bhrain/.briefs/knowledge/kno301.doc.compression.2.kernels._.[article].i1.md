# 🧩 .brief: `doc.kernel`

## .what
a **doc.kernel** is the **atomic variant of a document**.
it carries exactly **one concept**, expressed in its **minimal viable form**.
a kernel is not a pointer (like a ref), nor a structured articulation (like a brief) — it is the smallest **fertile expression** of a concept, portable across contexts.

---

## 🎯 purpose
- **seed** a concept for recomposition, growth, or articulation
- preserve integrity of a single idea while stripping away excess context
- provide a unit small enough to combine, cluster, or transplant into new docs

---

## ⚙️ properties
- **atomic** — cannot be reduced further without losing the concept
- **fertile** — can grow into a brief, article, or larger doc
- **portable** — independent of its original doc; reusable elsewhere
- **focused** — always represents *one and only one* concept

---

## 🔄 relation to other variants
- 🔖 **doc.ref** = *points* to a concept, but carries no content
- 🌱 **doc.kernel** = *seeds* a concept in its minimal expression
- 🪴 **doc.brief** = *carries* one or more concepts in structured, compressed form
- 📚 **doc** = *hosts* concepts at any scale, compression unspecified

---

## 📌 examples

### ⚖️ gravity
- 🌱 **doc.kernel:** `masses attract one another`

### 🎵 music
- 🌱 **doc.kernel:** `organized sound creates aesthetic or emotional experience`

### 🧩 triangle
- 🌱 **doc.kernel:** `a triangle has three sides`

---

## ✨ insight
a **doc.kernel** is the **seed-unit of conceptual materialization**:
- smaller than a brief, richer than a ref.
- designed for portability, recomposition, and growth.
- the foundation of the compression axis — the **irreducible carriers of meaning** inside the doc ecosystem.
