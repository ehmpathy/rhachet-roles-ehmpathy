# 🧩 .brief: `documents as vehicles of concept materialization`

## .what
**documents** are structured vehicles that materialize concepts by arranging instances into communicable form.
they are not the origin of concepts — which exist as real patterns in reality — but the **means by which those patterns are detected, revealed, and transmitted**.

---

## 🔗 relation to knowledge

- 🔹 **instances** = atoms, the raw substrate (events, data, specimens)
- 📑 **documents** = arrangements of instances that materialize concepts
- 🌐 **concepts** = patterns and relationships in reality, made perceptible through documents

\`\`\`
concepts (patterns in reality)
    ↓ materialized via
documents (organized arrangements of instances)
    ↓ grounded in
instances (atoms of raw data/experience)
\`\`\`

documents sit in the middle layer: they **leverage instances to reveal concepts**.

## 📖 archetypes of documents

documents take on distinct **treatment modes**, each shaping how concepts are materialized:

- 📖 **article — definitional**: clarifies *what a concept is* (e.g., Newton’s *Principia* → gravity)
- 🗂️ **catalog — organizational**: maps *how instances or sub-concepts relate* (e.g., periodic table → elements)
- 🎬 **demo — relational**: shows *how an instance exemplifies a concept* (e.g., Portland → walkability)
- 🎓 **lesson — pedagogical**: guides *how a concept is learned and practiced* (e.g., Euclid’s *Elements* → geometry)

---

## ✨ insight
- documents are **concept-materialization devices**, not concept-creation devices
- they are the **bridge**: grounding abstract structures in concrete instances
- multiple documents can materialize the same concept differently, and the same set of instances can support multiple concepts depending on arrangement

**in the architecture of knowledge:**
- 🔹 instances supply the *evidence*
- 📑 documents supply the *form*
- 🌐 concepts supply the *structure of reality*

together, they form a triad where documents are the **active medium of transmission and detection**.
