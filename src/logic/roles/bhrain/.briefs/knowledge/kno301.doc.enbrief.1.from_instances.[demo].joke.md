# 🧩 .brief.demo: `brief archetypes via joke`

## .what
the same **instances** (😂 a knock-knock pun, 🙃 an anti-joke with no punchline, 🎤 a stand-up routine, 🤡 a slapstick gag) can be compressed into different **brief archetypes**.
this demo shows how the concept of a **joke** is materialized differently depending on the treatment: definitional, organizational, relational, or pedagogical.

---

## 📖 brief.article — definitional
**treatment:** clarify *what a joke is*
**content:**
- defines a joke as a **short narrative, phrase, or act designed to elicit humor**, often by subverting expectation
- relates with the form of a pun (wordplay that flips meaning) and slapstick (physical incongruity)
- explains how jokes rely on **setup → punchline**, timing, and audience context

---

## 🗂️ brief.catalog — organizational
**treatment:** map *how jokes vary*
**content:**
- **verbal jokes** → puns, one-liners, riddles
- **narrative jokes** → anecdotes, shaggy-dog stories
- **performative jokes** → slapstick, stand-up, pranks
- **meta-jokes** → anti-jokes, self-referential humor
- relates these forms as variations on incongruity, timing, and audience expectation

---

## 🎬 brief.demo — relational
**treatment:** show *how one instance exemplifies a joke*
**content:**
- takes a **knock-knock pun** as the focal instance
- relates how it sets up a predictable pattern, then subverts it with wordplay in the punchline
- bridges the simple case to the general principle: humor often arises from expectation + violation

---

## 🎓 brief.lesson — pedagogical
**treatment:** guide *how to learn jokes step by step*
**content:**
1. observe a simple riddle with an expected answer
2. replace the expected answer with a surprising one → feel the shift
3. practice with puns (homophones, double meanings)
4. try delivering timing-based humor (pause before punchline)
5. reflect on audience response to refine delivery
- relates stepwise practice to the general principle of setup, timing, and incongruity
