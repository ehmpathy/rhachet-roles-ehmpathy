# 🧩 .brief.lesson: `articulate` via `template.structure.1`

## 💡 concept
to **articulate** is to give a `$concept` a **definitional treatment** by clarifying *what it is*, grounding it with examples, situating it in context, and distilling its significance.
this lesson shows step by step how to use **`template.structure.1`**, one of the most common article templates.

# 🧩 .brief.article: `$concept`

## 💡 what
[concise essence: what the `$concept` is, stated directly]

---

## [optional sections]
choose the sections that best articulate the `$concept`.

### 🔬 definition
[explain boundaries, mechanism, function, or distinguishing traits]

### 📌 instances
[list 1–3 representative examples that ground the concept]

### 🌍 context
[situate the concept in its domain, history, or contrast with related concepts]

### ✨ insight
[synthesis, implications, or why the concept matters beyond itself]

## 🛠️ practice
> how to fill out the template

1. **select a `$concept`**
   - choose one coherent topic (e.g., “symmetry,” “clarity,” “entropy”).
   - avoid bundling unrelated ideas.

2. **draft the `.what`**
   - write a one-sentence essence that defines the `$concept`.
   - this is the anchor and always required.

3. **add supporting sections**
   - **definition** → clarify boundaries, mechanism, or distinctions.
   - **instances** → ground the abstract with 1–3 clear examples.
   - **context** → place it in domain, history, or contrasts.
   - **insight** → synthesize significance and implications.
   - include only what strengthens clarity; skip the rest.

4. **compose and compress**
   - write in lowercase (except proper nouns).
   - favor concise lists and short paragraphs.
   - cut filler; maximize signal-to-noise.

5. **refine**
   - check clarity, completeness, and coherence.
   - ensure the article works as a definitional treatment.

## 🎯 goal
after completing this lesson, you should be able to **articulate any `$concept` into a `.brief.article` using `template.structure.1`**.
the result will be a clear, high-signal reference: anchored with a definition, optionally expanded with examples, context, and insights.
