# 🧩 .brief.article: `demonstrate`

## .what
**demonstrate** is the mechanism that **instantiates demos**: it materializes a concept as a relational treatment that shows how an instance exemplifies that concept.

---

## 🔬 definition
- **mechanism:** the materialization of a concept *as* demo form.
- **function:** reveals the concept through a chosen instance, making the abstract visible and graspable.
- **distinction:** articulation describes *what a demo is*; demonstrating performs the *instantiation* of a demo.

---

## 📌 examples
- to demonstrate “walkability,” one presents Portland as the focal instance, relating its sidewalks, mixed-use layout, and transit integration to the broader concept.
- to demonstrate “empathy,” one spotlights a nurse comforting a patient, relating this specific act of care to the general principle of understanding and sharing another’s feelings.

---

## ✨ insight
**demonstrate** is the bridge between **concept and exemplar**:
- it is the **mechanism** of showing concepts *in action* through instances.
- it ensures that demos are not just anecdotes but **systematic materializations** of concept–instance relations.

in knowledge architecture, **demonstrate** sits alongside mechanisms like **articulate** (articles), **catalogize** (catalogs), and **lessonize** (lessons), each materializing concepts in a distinct document mode.
