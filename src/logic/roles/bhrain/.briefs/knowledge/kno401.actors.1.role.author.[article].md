# 🧩 .brief.article: `author`

## .what
an **author** is the actor that **creates documents**: they materialize concepts by selecting and arranging instances into communicable forms such as articles, catalogs, demos, or lessons.

---

## 📑 scope of operation
- authors do **not** operate on collections; they originate documents.
- their role is to **materialize concepts into documents**, shaping raw instances into definitional, organizational, relational, or pedagogical treatments.
- where librarians weave documents into collections, authors weave instances into documents.

## 🔬 functions of an author
1. **concept selection** → choosing which concept to materialize.
2. **instance gathering** → collecting examples, cases, or data.
3. **treatment choice** → deciding whether to articulate, catalogize, demonstrate, or lessonize.
4. **composition** → structuring the document into coherent, transmissible form.
5. **expression** → shaping language, style, and framing to suit audience and purpose.

## 📌 examples

- **science:** an author creates a 📖 *document.article* defining “gravity,” a 🗂️ catalog of physical constants, a 🎬 demo of falling apples, or a 🎓 lesson on Newton’s laws.
- **philosophy:** an author creates a 📖 article (Plato on justice), a 🗂️ catalog (Aristotelian categories), a 🎬 demo (Socratic dialogue), or a 🎓 lesson (ethics curriculum).

## ✨ insight
- **authors** materialize concepts into *documents*.
- **librarians** materialize documents into *collections*.
- **readers** (to be articulated) materialize collections into *understanding*.

in knowledge architecture, the **author** is the entry point: without authors producing documents, there is nothing for librarians to curate or readers to interpret.
