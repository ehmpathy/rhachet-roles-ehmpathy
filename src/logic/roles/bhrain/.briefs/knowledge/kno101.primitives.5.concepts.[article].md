# 🧩 concepts (patterns in reality)

## .what
**concepts** are the abstract structures — patterns, relationships, or principles — that exist in reality independent of documentation.

They are the *meaning-bearing forms* discoverable in the fabric of events, behaviors, and phenomena.

---

## 🔬 characteristics
- **ontic** → exist whether or not they are recognized or documented
- **structural** → defined by relationships among instances, not by any single instance
- **stable** → persist across contexts, even if expressed differently
- **pluralizable** → the same instances can materialize multiple concepts, depending on arrangement

---

## 🧷 forms of concepts
- **physical principles** → gravity, inertia, thermodynamics
- **social patterns** → leadership, cooperation, conflict
- **biological relationships** → evolution, symbiosis, adaptation
- **abstract structures** → number, symmetry, causality

> note: these clusters are not exhaustive, but demonstrative

## 📌 examples
- **gravity**: the real force/pattern that governs attraction of masses
- **leadership**: the relational dynamic observable in human groups
- **symbiosis**: a biological relationship between species
- **justice**: a normative structure in social life

---

## ✨ role
- **existence:** independent of human recognition, concepts are “out there” in reality
- **discoverability:** documents make them perceptible by organizing instances
- **transmissibility:** once materialized in documents, concepts can be shared, taught, and critiqued
