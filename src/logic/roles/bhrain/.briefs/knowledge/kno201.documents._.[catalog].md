## 📊 compressed overview

| **archetype** | **what** |
|---------------|----------|
| 📖 **article**   | defines *what a concept is* |
| 🗂️ **catalog**   | organizes *how concepts/instances relate* |
| 🎬 **demo**      | exemplifies *how an instance shows a concept* |
| 🎓 **lesson**    | teaches *how a concept is learned/practiced* |

## 📖 1. article — definitional
**what:** clarifies *what a concept is* through explanation and boundary-setting
**forms:** encyclopedia entries, research papers, essays, reference guides
**examples:** Newton’s *Principia* (gravity), Wikipedia (photosynthesis), journal article (cognitive bias)
**role:** define, anchor, transmit shared meaning

---

## 🗂️ 2. catalog — organizational
**what:** maps *how instances or sub-concepts relate* within a system

## 🎬 3. demo — relational
**what:** shows *how a specific instance exemplifies a concept*
**forms:** case studies, simulations, narratives, worked examples, performances
**examples:** Portland (walkability), Ferrari F1-75 (racecar), clinical case (disease), role-play (conflict resolution)
**role:** reveal, bridge instance → concept, transmit intuitively

---

## 🎓 4. lesson — pedagogical
**what:** guides *how a concept is learned and practiced* via structured sequences
**forms:** textbooks, curricula, tutorials, workshops, training manuals
**examples:** Euclid’s *Elements* (geometry), coding tutorial (loops), biology chapter (cell division), first-aid manual
**role:** teach, scaffold, transmit across generations
