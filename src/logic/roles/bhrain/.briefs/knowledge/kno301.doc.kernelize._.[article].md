# 🧩 .brief.article: `<kernelize>`

## .what
**<kernelize>** is the mechanism that extracts 🌱 **doc.kernels** from any 📚 **doc**.
it reduces unstructured or expansive material into **atomic expressions**, each carrying **one concept**.
where a 📚 doc may hold many tangled ideas, <kernelize> isolates them into minimal, portable seeds.

---

## 🎯 purpose
- **distill**: strip away noise, phrasing, and redundancy
- **separate**: untangle multiple ideas into discrete units
- **stabilize**: preserve the integrity of each concept in its minimal viable form
- **prepare**: create fertile, portable kernels for use in 🔖 refs, 🪴 briefs, or new 📚 docs

---

## ⚙️ properties
- **one concept only** — every kernel carries exactly one concept
- **atomic** — irreducible without breaking the idea
- **fertile** — can grow into larger articulations (briefs, essays, treatises)
- **portable** — reusable across different contexts and documents

## 📌 examples

### ⚖️ gravity
source doc: *“the reason the apple falls is because earth pulls on it with a force — and in fact, any two masses in the universe attract each other.”*
kernels extracted:
- 🌱 `earth pulls on the apple`
- 🌱 `any two masses attract each other`

---

### 🎵 music
source doc: *“music happens when sounds are arranged in rhythm and melody, and harmony is what gives it depth.”*
kernels extracted:
- 🌱 `organized sound creates aesthetic experience`
- 🌱 `rhythm and melody distinguish music from noise`
- 🌱 `harmony creates depth in music`

---

### 🧩 triangle
source doc: *“a triangle is a polygon with three sides, three angles, and the sum of its angles is 180°.”*
kernels extracted:
- 🌱 `a triangle has three sides`
- 🌱 `a triangle has three angles`
- 🌱 `the sum of a triangle’s angles is 180°`

---

## ✨ insight
- 📚 docs contain many concepts, often entangled.
- **<kernelize>** untangles and harvests them into 🌱 kernels.
- kernels are the **minimal carriers of meaning** — richer than 🔖 refs, smaller than 🪴 briefs.
- they are the foundation of concept portability, indexing, and recomposition across the document ecosystem.
