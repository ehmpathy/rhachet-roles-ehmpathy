# 🧩 .brief.lesson: `articulate` via `template.structure1`

## .what
an **article** is a document that gives a **definitional treatment** of a `$concept`: it clarifies *what the concept is* by stating its essence, grounding it with instances, and situating it in context.
this lesson teaches how to use the **general `.brief.article` template** to articulate a concept into a clear, high-signal reference.

---

## 🎓 steps

1. **anchor with `.what`**
   - begin with a single-sentence essence that defines the `$concept`.
   - this is the only mandatory slot and locks the scope of the article.

2. **select supporting sections**
   - choose from the optional slots:
     - **definition** → expand boundaries, mechanism, or distinctions
     - **instances** → provide 1–3 representative examples
     - **context** → situate within a domain, history, or contrasts
     - **insight** → synthesize significance or implications
   - include only those that add clarity and signal.

3. **compose with tactics**
   - apply articulation tactics (e.g., compare-and-contrast, taxonomy positioning, question-driven expansion) to shape how the sections unfold.
   - the template is scaffolding, not a straightjacket — adapt section order or depth based on the concept’s nature.

4. **compress into structure**
   - keep prose lowercase (except proper nouns).
   - use concise lists and short paragraphs.
   - maximize signal-to-noise; cut filler.

\`\`\`md
# 🧩 .brief.article: `$concept`

## .what
[concise essence: what the `$concept` is, stated directly]

---

## [optional sections]
choose the sections that best articulate the `$concept`. not all are required — use what maximizes clarity and signal for this article.

### 🔬 definition
[explain boundaries, mechanism, function, or distinguishing traits]

### 📌 instances
[list 1–3 representative examples that ground the concept]

### 🌍 context
[situate the concept in its domain, history, or contrast with related concepts]

### ✨ insight
[synthesis, implications, or why the concept matters beyond itself]
\`\`\`

## 🛠️ practice
> how to fill out the template

1. **pick a `$concept`** (e.g., “entropy”).
2. **write the `.what`** in one sharp sentence.
3. **decide which sections help most**:
   - if the concept is abstract → lean on **instances** and **context**.
   - if it’s contested or fuzzy → emphasize **definition** and **distinctions**.
   - if it’s foundational → highlight **insight** into why it matters.
4. **apply tactics** to strengthen the draft.
5. **refine** until the article is clear, concise, and reusable.

## 🎯 goal
after completing this lesson, you should be able to **use the article-template flexibly**: always anchor with `.what`, and then expand with the most useful supporting sections. each article becomes a **definitional treatment** that is lean, clear, and tailored to its concept.
