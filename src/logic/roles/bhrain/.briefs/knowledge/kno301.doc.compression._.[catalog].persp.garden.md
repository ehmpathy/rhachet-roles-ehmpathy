# ðŸ§© .brief.catalog: `doc types as gardens`

## .what
these are **examples of ðŸ“š docs viewed through the compression axis**, expressed as garden metaphors.
they illustrate different ways concepts can be carried or hosted, but the list is **not exhaustive** â€” other forms of docs exist.

## ðŸ“Š compressed overview

| doc type         | garden type             | character                          | growth style                          |
|------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **ref**          | plant label / tag       | minimal, purely indicative          | marks seeds, sprouts, plots, or pots  |
| **kernel**       | seed                    | atomic, fertile, irreducible        | portable, can be planted anywhere     |
| **brief**        | portable garden (pot)   | compact, structured, self-contained | sprout-scale growth, transplantable   |
| **book**         | orchard                 | expansive, long-term                | cultivated trees with interlinked roots |
| **conversation** | wild plot               | untamed, fertile, messy             | spontaneous sprouts, weeds, mixed seeds |

## ðŸŽ¨ clusters

### ðŸ”– **ref = plant label**
- acts as a marker or tag in the garden.
- points to kernels, sprouts, or plots without carrying content.
- enables orientation and indexing.

---

### ðŸŒ± **kernel = seed**
- atomic, fertile unit.
- irreducible expression of one concept.
- can be harvested and transplanted into new soil.

---

### ðŸª´ **brief = portable garden (pot)**
- structured but compact.
- kernels transplanted from other soil.
- sprouts cultivated in a way thatâ€™s easy to move, share, or repurpose.

---

### ðŸŒ³ **book = orchard**
- long-term conceptual growth.
- cultivated trees arranged with intention.
- produces durable harvests, often interconnected.

---

### ðŸŒ¾ **conversation = wild plot**
- unstructured, seeds scattered by chance.
- sprouts and weeds intermingle.
- kernels must be harvested before reuse.

---

## ðŸŒ¿ implications
- these garden types are **illustrative examples of ðŸ“š docs along the compression axis**, not an exhaustive taxonomy.
- ðŸ”– **refs = labels** that point but donâ€™t carry.
- ðŸŒ± **kernels = seeds** that hold one fertile concept.
- ðŸª´ **briefs = pots** â€” portable gardens designed for clarity.
- ðŸŒ³ **books = orchards** â€” cultivated ecosystems of durable concepts.
- ðŸŒ¾ **conversations = wild plots** â€” messy, fertile, but unstructured scatterings of kernels.
