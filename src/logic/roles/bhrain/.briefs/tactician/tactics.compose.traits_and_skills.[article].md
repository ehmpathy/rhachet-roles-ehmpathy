# 🧩 .brief.article: `tactics as compositions of traits and skills`

## 💡 concept
**tactics** are not a strict hierarchy but a **composition** of **traits** and **skills**.
- **traits** = dispositions (orientations of thought, energy, and behavior).
- **skills** = capabilities (trainable abilities applied in practice).
a tactic emerges when a specific **combination** of traits and skills is aligned toward an outcome.

---

## 🎯 why composition matters
- traits and skills are **independent**: curiosity and precision can both shape chemistry, but in different ways.
- tactics are **composable**: the same skill can express differently depending on which trait anchors it.
- outcomes **shift** when traits or skills are dialed up, down, or swapped.

## 📚 examples by domain

### 🧪 science
**curious chemist**
- **trait**: curiosity
- **skill**: chemistry analysis
- **tactic**: exploratory experimentation, testing boundaries, embracing unknowns.
- **outcome**: discovery of novel reactions, unexpected insights.

**precise chemist**
- **trait**: precision
- **skill**: chemistry analysis
- **tactic**: rigorous measurement, narrow tolerances, strict replication.
- **outcome**: reliable results, industry-grade reproducibility.

### 🪚 craft
**adaptive carpenter**
- **trait**: creativity
- **skill**: carpentry
- **tactic**: improvises with available materials, adapts joinery to context.
- **outcome**: unique custom pieces, practical fixes in resource-limited settings.

**disciplined carpenter**
- **trait**: discipline
- **skill**: carpentry
- **tactic**: follows measured plans precisely, applies standardized methods.
- **outcome**: consistent, repeatable, structurally sound products.

### 🤝 negotiation
**empathetic negotiator**
- **trait**: empathy
- **skill**: negotiation
- **tactic**: listens deeply, frames deals around shared needs.
- **outcome**: durable agreements, long-term trust.

**strategic negotiator**
- **trait**: foresight
- **skill**: negotiation
- **tactic**: maps long-term consequences, anticipates concessions and pivots.
- **outcome**: advantage in complex deals, positioning for future leverage.

---

## ⚖️ composability
- one **skill** can pair with multiple **traits** → different tactics, different outcomes.
- one **trait** can pair with multiple **skills** → different expressions of the same disposition.
- **tactics** emerge from the active **pairing**, not from traits or skills alone.

---

## 📌 takeaway
tactics are **compositions**, not hierarchies:
- **traits** provide orientation.
- **skills** provide capability.
- tactics combine them to yield different **outcomes**, which can shift as traits are dialed differently in different contexts.
