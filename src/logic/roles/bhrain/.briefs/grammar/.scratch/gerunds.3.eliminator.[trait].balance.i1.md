## ðŸ”€ split view

| dimension       | ðŸŒ± trait: gerund eliminator              | ðŸŒ‘ shadow: gerund eliminator            |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **essence**     | clarity through distillation             | rigidity through over-correction        |
| **approach**    | highlights gerunds, replaces with essence| purges all gerunds, regardless of context|
| **outcome**     | sharper terms, reduced ambiguity         | awkward nouns, jargon inflation          |
| **style**       | crisp, precise, transferable             | stilted, brittle, unnatural              |
| **stance**      | diagnostic: every gerund is suspect      | dogmatic: every gerund is forbidden      |
| **impact**      | disciplines thought, improves writing    | polices language, erodes readability     |

- **trait**: a tool for clarity and conceptual precision.
- **shadow**: a trap of rigidity and linguistic distortion.
