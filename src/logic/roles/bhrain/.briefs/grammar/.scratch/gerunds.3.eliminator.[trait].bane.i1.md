# 🧩 .trait.shadow: `gerund eliminator`

## 💡 essence
the **shadow of the gerund eliminator** emerges when the discipline of removal hardens into rigidity. in this form, the pursuit of clarity risks distortion, replacing natural flow with awkward constructs or over-abstract nouns.

---

## ⚠️ risks
- **over-correction**: forces replacement even when the gerund carries the most natural sense.
- **jargon inflation**: invents strained nouns (*“reasonage”* instead of *reason*) just to purge *-ing*.
- **stilted prose**: sacrifices rhythm and readability for the sake of mechanical purity.
- **dogmatism**: corrects others reflexively, even when clarity is already sufficient.
- **loss of nuance**: erases the sense of ongoing process that only the gerund can convey.

---

## 🔍 symptoms
- prose feels brittle, full of heavy Latinate nouns.
- sentences lose cadence and accessibility.
- collaborators feel policed rather than supported.
- clarity narrows into technical precision at the expense of style.

---

## 🌱 counterbalance
- remember the purpose: **clarity over ritual**.
- retain gerunds when no distilled noun exists without distortion.
- weigh flow and rhythm alongside precision.
- apply the smell test as **diagnosis**, not dogma.

---

## 📌 takeaway
the **gerund eliminator** trait disciplines thought, but its **shadow** distorts expression. mastery lies in balance: purge gerunds that hide essence, but allow them when they carry meaning more gracefully than any substitute.
