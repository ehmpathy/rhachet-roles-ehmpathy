# 🧩 .brief.article: `eliminate gerunds in prose`

## 🌟 introduction
the removal of gerunds (*-ing* forms used as nouns) is a deliberate tactic to sharpen language. gerunds often act as **term smells** — signs that the concept has not been distilled to its essence. by replacement with precise nouns, prose becomes clearer, more direct, and more transferable.

---

## 🎯 purpose of the tactic
- **distill essence**: shift from description of activity to naming of outcome, resource, or structure.
- **remove ambiguity**: avoid blurred meanings (e.g., *“text”* vs. the act of inscription).
- **increase precision**: force the author to clarify whether they mean *plan*, *strategy*, *education*, *knowledge*, etc.
- **discipline thought**: strengthen conceptual rigor by avoiding convenient but vague shortcuts.

---

## 🔍 how the tactic works
1. **scan text for gerund forms** (*-ing words that function as nouns*).
   - examples: *thought, plan, structure, network* as replacements.
2. **apply the smell test**: substitution, scope, outcome, and convenience.
3. **replace with distilled nouns** that capture the core meaning.
   - *thought* instead of “thinking”
   - *plan / strategy / coordination* instead of “planning”
   - *relationships / contacts / repute* instead of “networking”

in disciplined prose, *every gerund is guilty until proven otherwise*.
