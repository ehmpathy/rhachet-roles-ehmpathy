## 📋 the checklist

### 1. scan
- highlight every word ending in **-ing**.
- mark especially those functioning as **subjects, objects, or abstract nouns**.

### 2. test
apply four filters to each marked word:
- **substitution**: can a sharper noun replace it? (*planning → plan / strategy*)
- **scope**: does the word blur multiple meanings? (*writing → text / skill / act*)
- **outcome**: does the word describe action instead of result? (*training → discipline / instruction*)
- **convenience**: was the word chosen as an easy placeholder?

### 3. replace
swap the gerund with the distilled term:
- “thinking” → *thought, reason, cognition*
- “building” → *structure, edifice*
- “networking” → *relationships, contacts, repute*

### 4. re-read
ensure the new noun preserves intent and increases clarity.
if meaning shifted, refine further.

## 🛠️ usage rule
- treat every gerund as **guilty until proven otherwise**.
- only retain *-ing* when no sharper essence exists.
- prefer concrete nouns (artifact, structure, resource, outcome) over vague activity labels.

## 📌 takeaway
the **gerund removal checklist** provides a repeatable method for editing prose. it ensures that each concept is expressed in its distilled form, eliminating fuzzy placeholders and strengthening conceptual precision.
