# 🧩 .brief.lesson: `gerund smell test`

## 💡 concept
a **gerund smell test** helps detect when a concept named with *-ing* is really a sign of insufficient distillation. it forces us to sharpen fuzzy process-terms into precise nouns that capture the essence.

---

## 🎯 purpose
- prevent sloppy terminology by avoiding “process-as-thing” placeholders.
- guide thinkers toward more distilled, essential names.
- improve clarity and transferability of concepts in writing, design, or theory.

## 🧪 the smell test

### 1. substitution test
> can the gerund be replaced with a sharper noun?

- *“learning” → knowledge*
- *“building” → structure*
- *“teaching” → education*
- *“thinking” → thought*

if the substitution makes meaning clearer, the gerund is a smell.

---

### 2. scope clarity test
> does the gerund blur multiple senses?

- *“writing”* could mean:
  - the act (scribbling on paper)
  - the product (a text)
  - the system (written language)
  - the skill (literacy)

if it leaks across senses, the gerund is a smell.

---

### 3. outcome test
> does the gerund describe activity instead of the result?

- *“planning”* → could resolve into:
  - **plan** (artifact)
  - **strategy** (essence)
  - **coordination** (process with defined outcome)

if the activity is masking a clearer outcome, the gerund is a smell.

---

### 4. convenience test
> is the gerund just the easiest way out?

- *“networking”* → a shortcut for “relationships,” “contacts,” or “repute.”
if the term looks like it was coined because *-ing* was handy, it’s a smell.

---

## 📚 practice exercise
take common gerunds and refine them:
- **thinking** → thought, cognition, reason
- **doing** → action, execution, behavior
- **training** → instruction, discipline, practice
- **meeting** → gathering, session, council

---

## 📌 takeaway
if a term ends in *-ing*, run it through the **gerund smell test**.
if it fails even one check, distill it to its essence. clarity improves, concepts sharpen, and your system of terms becomes more robust.
