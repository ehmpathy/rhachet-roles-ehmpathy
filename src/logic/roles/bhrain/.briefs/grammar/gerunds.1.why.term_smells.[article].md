# 🧩 why gerunds can be "term smells"

## 🚩 what is a "term smell"
a **term smell** is like a code smell: a sign that a term may not be well-formed, clear, or fully thought through. it doesn’t always mean the term is wrong, but it hints at a lack of conceptual distillation.

## 🧩 why gerunds raise suspicion
- **process disguised as essence**
  gerunds often point to *doing* rather than a distilled *thing*.
  *e.g., “learning” as a noun refers to the act, but what we might mean is “knowledge” (the distilled outcome).*

- **vagueness of scope**
  gerunds blur whether we mean one instance (*a running race*), the general process (*running in general*), or an abstract quality (*endurance*). this ambiguity can signal sloppy conceptualization.

- **placeholder convenience**
  gerunds are easy to generate. instead of carefully naming the core concept, we default to *-ing*.
  *e.g., “networking” instead of specifying “relationships,” “contacts,” or “repute.”*

## 🌀 signs of insufficient distillation
- the term **describes activity** but doesn’t identify the **underlying resource, structure, or outcome**.
  *“teaching” vs. “education,” “building” vs. “structure,” “thinking” vs. “thought.”*

- the term **feels broad or leaky**, covering multiple senses at once.
  *“writing” could mean the act, the system, the product, or the skill.*

- the term **fails test of substitution**: if we try to define it without the *-ing* form, we get sharper distinctions.
  *“planning” → could resolve to “plan” (artifact), “process of coordination” (activity), or “strategy” (essence).*

## 📌 takeaway
gerunds are common because they’re convenient.
they’re **term smells** because convenience can mask lack of distillation — using the *doing* form instead of naming the **essence** of what’s really meant.
