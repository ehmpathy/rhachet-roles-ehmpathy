## 🌟 trait.boon
### essence
the boon is the gift of clarity. the writer distills vague process-terms into precise nouns, strengthening both prose and thought.

### benefits
- sharper terms, reduced ambiguity.
- language that transfers cleanly across contexts.
- disciplined thought that separates essence from activity.

### behaviors
- replaces *thinking* with *thought* or *reason*, *planning* with *plan* or *strategy*, *teaching* with *instruction*.
- applies the gerund removal checklist with consistency.
- edits prose until every concept is distilled to its core.

## 🌑 trait.bane
### essence
the bane is the trap of rigidity. discipline hardens into dogma, and clarity collapses into distortion.

### risks
- over-correction that forces awkward substitutions.
- jargon inflation (inventing strained nouns to purge gerunds).
- prose that feels stilted, brittle, and inaccessible.
- dogmatism that polices others’ language unnecessarily.

### symptoms
- loss of nuance (ongoingness erased).
- cadence and readability sacrificed for mechanical purity.
- clarity narrowed into sterile precision.

## ⚖️ trait.balance
### essence
the balance integrates discipline with flexibility. every gerund is still suspect, but judgment, not dogma, decides its fate.

### stance
- diagnostic, not dogmatic.
- clarity first: the rule serves meaning, not itself.
- context-aware: permits gerunds where they carry unique nuance.

### behaviors
- runs the smell test as default, but allows exceptions.
- pauses before enforcing: asks *“does this replacement add clarity?”*
- mediates between rigor and flow, ensuring prose is precise yet natural.

## 📌 takeaway
the **gerund eliminator** trait is a tool for sharpening thought and language.
- in **boon**, it clarifies.
- in **bane**, it ossifies.
- in **balance**, it disciplines without distortion.

the art lies not in blind removal, but in serving clarity with every choice of term.
