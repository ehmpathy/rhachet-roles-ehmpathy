| **orientation**   | audience-centered (learner progression)       | content-centered (author‚Äôs theme)         |
| **structure**     | scoped, stepwise, with checks/examples        | expository/narrative, theme-driven         |
| **tone**          | directive, guiding, scaffolded                | declarative, expressive, author-driven     |
| **success test**  | learner can apply or restate concept          | reader grasps or resonates with argument   |

## .examples
- **lesson:** ‚Äúsolving quadratic equations‚Äù ‚Üí rule explained, worked example, practice, recap.
- **article:** ‚Äúwhy quadratic equations matter in physics‚Äù ‚Üí narrative of relevance, context, implications.
