# ðŸ§© .brief: lessons vs articles vs demos in llm context

## .what
within an llmâ€™s **context window**, you can load knowledge in the form of **lessons**, **articles**, or **demos**. each has a distinct function:
- **lessons** = structured scaffolds â†’ optimize for clarity & transfer.
- **articles** = expository text â†’ optimize for articulation & tone.
- **demos** = concrete examples â†’ optimize for showing *how it looks in practice*.

---

## .why (purpose)
- **lessons:** to make the llm *reproduce structured reasoning* and stepwise clarity.
- **articles:** to make the llm *mirror articulation, genre, and style*.
- **demos:** to make the llm *imitate patterns through example-based learning*.

## .model

| axis              | **lessons in context**                          | **articles in context**                        | **demos in context**                        |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **core fusion**   | explain Ã— articulate (scaffolded knowledge)     | articulate (may include explain)               | example (observable instance)                |
| **strengths**     | clarity, stepwise structure, reusable templates | tone, breadth, rhetorical and stylistic form   | concreteness, fast pattern transfer          |
| **weaknesses**    | narrow scope, less stylistic variety            | verbose, less causal scaffolding               | shallow (shows *what*, not *why*)           |
| **best use**      | teaching, tutoring, problem-solving             | style transfer, persuasion, context-rich tasks | training-by-example, template replication   |

---

## .takeaway
- **lessons** compress rules into structured, reusable scaffolds.
- **articles** convey style and breadth of articulation.
- **demos** shortcut learning by showing *what to do*, often with minimal explanation.

**in llm context:**
- for *clarity & reasoning* â†’ use **lessons**.
- for *style & rhetoric* â†’ use **articles**.
- for *pattern mimicry* â†’ use **demos**.
