# 🧩 .brief: `frame vs perspective`

## .what
**frame** and **perspective** are paired tools for concept articulation:
- **frame** = a **structural skeleton** — a variant pattern of slots and relations that can be applied to a concept to shape *how* it is organized in articulation. Multiple frames may be applied to the same concept to produce structurally different materializations.
- **perspective** = the **viewpoint** or **angle of approach** used to fill that skeleton with content, shaping emphasis, tone, and interpretation.

---

## 🎯 goal
- **frame**: provide an organizing pattern for a concept’s articulation.
- **perspective**: give a contextual lens for filling the pattern.
- together: allow re-framing (structural variation) and re-viewing (interpretive variation) of the same concept.

## 🔎 core distinctions

| aspect | **frame** | **perspective** |
|---|---|---|
| nature | structural pattern (variant skeleton) | interpretive angle (role, motive, context) |
| function | determines *what slots exist* and *how they relate* | determines *how slots are filled* and *what’s emphasized* |
| multiplicity | many possible per concept | many possible per concept |
| change effect | reorganizes the articulation | shifts tone, focus, interpretation |
| metaphor | skeleton blueprint | lens |

## 🧭 minimal definitions

### frame
- **slots**: named fields/dimensions (e.g., `.what`, `.why`, `.how`)
- **relations**: how slots link or depend on each other
- **order/shape**: sequence, grouping, or hierarchy
- **constraints**: invariants within that frame variant
- **acuity rules**: expected detail per slot

### perspective
- **vantage**: whose view or role is filling the frame
- **tone/style**: language and metaphor choices
- **priority**: which slots get richer vs minimal detail
- **filter**: what’s omitted or downplayed
- **interpretation**: how the facts are cast in meaning

## ⚙️ workflow pattern

1. **<select.frame>** — choose the skeleton variant best suited to the goal.
2. **<choose.perspective>** — pick the lens: role, priorities, style.
3. **<materialize>** — fill the frame from that perspective.
4. **<compare.perspectives>** — same frame, varied fills.
5. **<compare.frames>** — same concept, varied skeletons.

---

## 🧷 interplay rules

- **frame** = structural variation; **perspective** = interpretive variation.
- multiple **frames** allow reorganizing the same concept into different slot structures.
- multiple **perspectives** allow different voices or priorities for the same structure.
- changing **frame** may change the relationships between elements; changing **perspective** does not.

## 🧯 blue-collar example

**concept**: “buying a work truck”

- **frame A** (decision frame):
  1. purpose
  2. requirements
  3. options
  4. decision
  5. rationale

- **frame B** (risk–benefit frame):
  1. risks
  2. mitigations
  3. benefits
  4. trade-offs
  5. selection

- **perspectives** for either frame:
  - **owner**: ROI, fuel, maintenance cost.
  - **foreman**: uptime, ruggedness.
  - **driver**: comfort, safety.

Same **concept**, different **frames** change *structure*, different **perspectives** change *interpretation*.

---

## 📌 summary
- **frame** = skeleton variant — structural pattern that organizes articulation.
- **perspective** = lens — interpretive angle that colors the fill.
you can re-frame for structural changes, re-view for interpretive changes, or combine both for maximum variation.
