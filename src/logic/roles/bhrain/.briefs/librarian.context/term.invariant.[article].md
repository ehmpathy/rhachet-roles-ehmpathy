# 🧩 .brief: def(`invariant`)

## .what
an **invariant** is a property, condition, or quantity that remains unchanged while other elements of a system vary — as long as the system’s rules or constraints are respected.

---

## 🎯 goal
to define and preserve **consistency** across changes, ensuring that certain truths or conditions hold steady regardless of variation in other factors.

---

## 📍 scope
- **mathematics** — values or relationships that remain constant under specific transformations
- **programming** — conditions that must always be true during program execution
- **physics** — measurable properties that do not change across frames of reference or states
- **logic / reasoning** — truths that persist across all considered cases

---

## 💡 examples
- **math**: in euclidean geometry, the distance between two points is invariant under rotation.
- **programming**: in a sorted array, `array[i] <= array[i+1]` is an invariant.
- **physics**: the speed of light in a vacuum is invariant for all inertial observers.

---

## 🔍 note
violating an invariant often signals a **break in the system’s rules** or a **logical error** in reasoning or implementation.
