# 🧩 .brief: `assumption vs expectation`

## .what
**assumption** and **expectation** are two closely related concepts that shape how we perceive and interact with the world. An **assumption** is a belief or supposition taken as true without proof or concrete evidence. It often functions unconsciously to fill gaps in what we think we know. An **expectation**, on the other hand, is a belief about the anticipated outcome or behavior of someone or something; it is often based on past experience, communication, or desire.

---

## 🎯 purpose
- distinguish between passive beliefs (assumptions) and active forecasts (expectations)
- clarify how each informs decision-making and mindset
- prevent misunderstandings and misalignments in communication and planning

## 📐 dimensions

### assumption
- **definition**: a belief taken for granted without substantiation; a starting point for reasoning that lacks direct evidence.
- **origin**: emerges from prior experiences, cultural norms, or incomplete data.
- **effect**: shapes perspective subtly, often unacknowledged; can lead to blind spots if unexamined.
  
### expectation
- **definition**: an anticipated outcome or behavior considered likely or desired, inferred from patterns of past interactions or guidance.
- **origin**: formed from past experience, explicit statements, or personal goals and desires.
- **effect**: guides behavior and emotional responses; unmet expectations can result in disappointment or frustration.

---

## 🔗 relations
- **assumptions can influence expectations**: unacknowledged assumptions can set unrealistic or inaccurate expectations.
- **expectations shape interactions**: clear expectations improve communication and collaboration, reducing surprises and conflict.

## 💡 examples

### assumptions
- assuming someone knows how to operate a device without instruction.
- believing a project will take a standard amount of time without considering unique complexities.

### expectations
- expecting a colleague to reply to emails within 24 hours based on previous patterns.
- anticipating software to perform a specific function because it was advertised to do so.

---

## 🌀 contrast & synthesis

### distinguish
- assumptions are often less conscious and lack immediate validation.
- expectations are typically more explicit and testable against reality.

### integrate
- actively recognizing and questioning assumptions can refine expectations into more effective tools for predicting and navigating future scenarios.

---

## 📌 application
- **in planning**: explicitly state and validate assumptions to ensure realistic expectations and successful outcomes.
- **in communication**: acknowledge and align on expectations to foster understanding and collaboration.
