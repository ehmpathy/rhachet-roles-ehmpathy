# 🧩 .brief: `expectation vs assumption`

## .what
**expectation** and **assumption** are both mental stances about the future, but they differ in how explicitly they are held and what they imply about reality.

- **expectation** = an *explicitly held anticipation* of how something will unfold, often tied to standards, promises, or probabilities.
- **assumption** = an *implicit presumption* taken for granted, often unexamined, serving as a starting point for reasoning or action.

---

## 🎯 purpose
- clarify the difference between **anticipating outcomes** (expectation) and **presuming conditions** (assumption).
- prevent hidden assumptions from masquerading as guaranteed expectations.
- support better reasoning, planning, and communication by surfacing what is expected vs. what is assumed.

## ⚖️ comparison

| aspect            | expectation                                     | assumption                                    |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **awareness**     | conscious, often stated or agreed upon          | unconscious, implicit, may remain unstated    |
| **orientation**   | future-oriented: what will / should happen      | present/baseline-oriented: what is taken as true |
| **basis**         | evidence, norms, or commitments                 | mental shortcuts, default beliefs             |
| **function**      | guides hopes, standards, and evaluations        | simplifies reasoning, sets context            |
| **risk**          | unmet → leads to disappointment or conflict     | false → leads to errors or misjudgments       |

## 📐 examples

- **expectation:** “the contractor will finish the job by friday because that was the agreed deadline.”
- **assumption:** “the contractor has the right tools to finish the job.”

- **expectation:** “my friend will call me back after work.”
- **assumption:** “my friend is free after work.”

## 📊 insight
- **expectations** tend to be **externalized** (communicated, measurable, standard-based).
- **assumptions** tend to be **internalized** (invisible, default, belief-based).
- surfacing assumptions can help convert them into clearer expectations, reducing misalignment.
