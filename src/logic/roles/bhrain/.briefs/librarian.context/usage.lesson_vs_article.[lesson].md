- **articles** = expository, narrative, stylistic content â†’ optimized for articulation and tone.

---

## .why (purpose)
- **lessons:** maximize transfer of reasoning patterns, problem-solving steps, and teaching clarity.

| axis              | **lessons in context**                          | **articles in context**                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **core fusion**   | explain Ã— articulate (scaffolded knowledge)     | articulate (may include explain)            |
| **strengths**     | clarity, stepwise structure, reusable templates | tone, breadth, rhetorical and stylistic form |
| **weaknesses**    | narrow scope, less stylistic variety            | verbose, less causal scaffolding             |
| **best use**      | teaching, tutoring, applied reasoning tasks     | style transfer, perspective capture          |

## .takeaway
- **lessons compress more usable value per token** â†’ best for clarity, reasoning, and consistency.
- **articles provide articulation patterns** â†’ best for stylistic or rhetorical goals.
