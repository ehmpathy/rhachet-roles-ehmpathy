# 🧩 .brief: `<cluster>`

## .what
**`<cluster>`** is a **focus motion** that groups together multiple `[branches]` (concept instances) based on shared features or relational affinity.
it reduces a field of scattered items into **cohesive formations** — making patterns, categories, or themes explicit.

---

## 🎯 goal
- compress variance into **organized sets**
- highlight **underlying affinities** across seemingly distinct items
- prepare the ground for **higher-order generalization** (e.g., abstraction, naming, synthesis)
- enable **navigation by category** instead of by raw item list

---

## ⚙️ thought process

1. **scan variance**
   - begin with a scattered set of `[branches]` (from `<diverge>` or raw input)
   - note distinguishing traits, overlaps, and recurring signals

2. **spot affinities**
   - identify where items share a **dimension of similarity** (semantic, categorical, functional, causal, relational, etc.)
   - surface possible "gravity centers" that pull items into groups

3. **define boundaries**
   - carve out **clusters**: each with a center (defining trait) and edge (membership scope)
   - check that boundaries are neither too broad (all items lumped) nor too narrow (degenerate singletons)

4. **label & test**
   - propose candidate labels (descriptors, names, categories)
   - test each label against members: does it explain *why* they belong?
   - revise clusters if coherence is weak

5. **reflect structure**
   - step back to assess **balance of clusters**
     - are there outliers?
     - are clusters roughly comparable in granularity?
   - note if new clusters reveal **hidden dimensions** worth re-diverging

---

## 🌀 motion shape
- inward **centripetal pull**: items drawn toward shared centers
- convergent compression: many scattered → fewer grouped
- stabilizing: reduces chaos into a **structured lattice**

---

## 🛠️ usecases
- organizing brainstormed ideas into themes
- categorizing customer feedback by pain-point
- sorting research findings by dimension
- preparing divergent material for synthesis or decision
