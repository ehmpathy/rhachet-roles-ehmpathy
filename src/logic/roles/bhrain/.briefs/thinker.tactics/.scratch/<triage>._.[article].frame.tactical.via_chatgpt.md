# 🧩 .brief: `triage`

## .what
**`<triage>`** is a **selection tactic** used to quickly sort and prioritize a set of items, signals, or options according to their urgency, importance, or relevance.
it emphasizes **speed and clarity of disposition**, ensuring that attention and resources are directed where they matter most.

---

## 🎯 purpose
- to impose **order on incoming volume** (ideas, tasks, claims, issues, etc.)
- to **separate the critical from the trivial** without exhaustive analysis
- to create a **clear next-step map**: act, defer, discard

---

## ⚙️ method

1. **collect inflow**
   - gather the unfiltered items awaiting disposition

2. **apply criteria**
   - define rapid heuristics: urgency, impact, feasibility, relevance
   - keep criteria simple, repeatable, and transparent

3. **sort into buckets**
   - **critical**: requires immediate action or focus
   - **important**: to be scheduled, delegated, or handled deliberately
   - **nonessential**: safe to defer, ignore, or discard

4. **assign pathways**
   - give each bucket a defined outlet (e.g., act now, queue, archive)
   - ensure items don’t stagnate in limbo

---

## 🔑 traits
- **fast over perfect**: the goal is quick clarity, not deep analysis
- **criteria-driven**: reduces bias by using simple consistent rules
- **action-oriented**: each item ends with a disposition, not a stall

## 🖼 examples

### 1. customer support inbox
**inflow:**
- “site is down in new york”
- “update my billing address”
- “add dark mode someday”

**triage:**
- **critical →** “site is down in new york”
- **important →** “update my billing address”
- **nonessential →** “add dark mode someday”

---

### 2. idea brainstorming session
**inflow:**
- “use drones for roof inspections”
- “add QR codes on flyers”
- “build our own satellite”

**triage:**
- **critical/high-impact →** “use drones for roof inspections”
- **important/promising →** “add QR codes on flyers”
- **nonessential/impractical →** “build our own satellite”

---

### 3. emergency room intake
**inflow:**
- patient with chest pain
- patient with broken wrist
- patient with a mild headache

**triage:**
- **critical →** chest pain (immediate treatment)
- **important →** broken wrist (stabilize, treat next)
- **nonessential →** mild headache (safe to defer)
