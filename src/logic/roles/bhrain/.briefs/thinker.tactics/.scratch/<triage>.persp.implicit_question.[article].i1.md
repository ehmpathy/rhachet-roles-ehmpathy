# 🧩 .brief: `triage`

## .what

**triage** in a conceptual context is essentially a **thought tactic** that is executed based on a set of underlying **questions**. These questions — whether explicit or implicit — guide the process by defining the criteria upon which decisions are made. They determine the **dimensions** or attributes along which elements are measured, prioritized, and categorized.

---

## 🎯 purpose

- **organize** and **prioritize** elements for more efficient processing
- enable quick **decision making** by filtering based on predefined questions or criteria
- surface the **most critical elements** from a complex set for immediate action

---

## 🔍 how it works

Triage involves:

1. **identify guiding questions**:
   - determine what specific **questions** (e.g., what's most urgent?) direct the triage process.
   - these questions effectively articulate what aspects need to be measured and how.

2. **define measurement dimensions**:
   - each guiding question establishes a **dimension** (e.g., urgency, complexity, impact).
   - elements are then evaluated and sorted based on their characteristics along these dimensions.

3. **prioritize based on responses**:
   - responses to the questions inform the **ranking** and **prioritization** of elements.
   - the process dynamically adjusts focus to what is deemed most important or time-sensitive.

## 🧠 example

In a medical setting, a triage nurse may ask:
- **what is the severity of the injury?**
  - dimension: urgency
- **what resources are available?**
  - dimension: availability
- **what is the patient's stability?**
  - dimension: stability

These questions help categorize patients and determine the order of treatment.

## 🔄 relationship to questions

- **questions as vectors**:
  - each question serves as a semantic vector, directing focus and operational motion.
  - questions resolve into answers, or prioritize elements based on contextual criteria.

- **triage as applied questioning**:
  - acts as a method of applying explicit or implicit questions to streamline thought and decision processes.

---

## 📐 when to use

- when facing **information overload** or needing to manage **limited resources**
- in situations demanding rapid **decision-making** under pressure
- where there is a need to isolate **critical elements** from a mixed set of data

---

## 💡 notes

- triage should be adaptable, adjusting guiding questions and criteria as context and goals shift.
- crucial to ensure the triage questions are relevant and comprehensive to avoid oversight.
- can be used beyond emergencies, in project management, learning prioritization, and more.
