# 🧩 .brief: `triage as question-based tactic`

## .what

`triage` in thought processes is fundamentally a **question-based tactic**. This perspective suggests that triage is driven by **explicit or implicit questions** that determine the **dimensions** along which various elements or tasks are assessed and prioritized.

---

## 🎯 purpose
- to **prioritize effectively** — identifying which elements need immediate attention and which can be postponed or discarded
- to ensure that the **most critical issues** are addressed in a structured manner
- to provide a clear framework for **decision-making** in complex or time-pressured situations

---

## 🌀 triage dynamics

### 1. question-driven assessment
- **defining criteria**: Each triage process is guided by specific questions that focus on what matters most.
  - e.g., "Which tasks have the highest impact?" or "What must be solved immediately?"

### 2. dimension selection
- **criteria alignment**: Questions help in selecting the dimensions of assessment, such as urgency, importance, or risk.

- **main question**: "Which project aligns best with our strategic goals?"
  - **assessment dimensions**:
    - potential ROI
    - strategic alignment
    - resource requirements

### information overload management
- **main question**: "Which information is most crucial to process immediately?"
  - **assessment dimensions**:
    - relevance to current objectives
    - urgency of response required
    - impact on future decisions

## 🌿 implications for practice

- adopting a question-based triage framework can make prioritization more transparent and justifiable.
- defining clear, shared questions ensures all involved parties understand **why decisions are made**, improving collaboration and buy-in.

## 💭 reflections

Consider whether:
- the questions used in your triage process effectively cover all necessary dimensions.
