# üß© .brief: `thought process of <triage>`

## .what

The `<triage>` operation involves **prioritizing, sorting, and categorizing** concepts, issues, or data points to address the most critical items first. It leverages urgency, importance, and impact criteria to allocate resources efficiently and tackle problems in a strategically sound order.

---

## üéØ purpose

- to allocate attention and resources effectively, particularly under constraints
- to manage complex sets of tasks, concepts, or issues by determining priority
- to achieve greater efficiency and impact in decision-making processes

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è method

1. **gather elements**
   - compile the full scope of tasks, issues, or data points needing triage
   - ensure a comprehensive representation to inform prioritization

2. **establish criteria**
   - define criteria for urgency, importance, and potential impact
   - criteria should be clear, consistent, and aligned with strategic goals

3. **evaluate and prioritize**
   - assess each element against the criteria
   - rank based on priority, grouping into immediate, short-term, and long-term categories

4. **execute and monitor**
   - address elements according to their prioritization
   - continuously monitor for changes in context or priority requiring adjustment

## üß† cognitive basis

Triage utilizes cognitive functions related to decision-making, prioritization, and problem-solving. It relies on both analytical assessments and judgment calls to manage complexity effectively and ensure the most crucial actions are taken first.

---

## üìê when to use

- during crises or time-sensitive situations where quick decision-making is essential
- when managing extensive lists of tasks, responsibilities, or issues needing resolution
- when aligning team focus and resources with high-impact objectives

---

## üîÅ dynamic behavior

Triage is inherently dynamic, often involving frequent re-evaluation as context shifts or new information emerges. This flexibility ensures continued relevance and efficacy in response to changing priorities.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è caution: over-triage

Avoid excessive triaging, which can lead to analysis paralysis or neglect of less critical but still important tasks. Ensure balance between granular prioritization and broad-sketch planning.

---

## üß∞ use it for:

- emergency management and crisis response
- project management and workflow optimization
- strategic planning and resource allocation

---

## üìä examples

1. **Emergency Room Triage**
   - Assessing incoming patients to prioritize those with life-threatening conditions over less urgent cases.

2. **Project Management**
   - Prioritizing project tasks based on deadlines, resource availability, and potential impact on project success.

3. **Strategic Planning**
   - Sorting organizational goals and initiatives to focus on those most likely to drive long-term success.

4. **Customer Support**
   - Filtering support tickets to address high-priority or escalated issues before general inquiries.
