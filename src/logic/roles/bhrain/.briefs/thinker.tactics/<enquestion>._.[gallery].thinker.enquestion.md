## üéØ example ‚Äî `<enquestion>` devtime PonderQuestions kit for `<envision>` a `[product][journey]` ‚Üí runtime reuse

**intent**
Produce a **general-purpose devtime `PonderQuestions` kit** for `<envision>` a `[product][journey]`.
At **runtime**, a product strategist, designer, or founder can plug in case-specific facts about the product and its audience, reusing this kit for **every journey-mapping session** to ensure nothing critical is overlooked.

### üì• devtime input to `<enquestion>`
\`\`\`ts
ponder: {
  contextualize: [
    "which key stages should *spawn* exploration of user touchpoints?",
    "which external constraints or dependencies might *alter* the journey flow?",
    "which success/failure signals at each stage would *generate* follow-up mapping?"
  ],
  conceptualize: [
    "which types of users or segments should *spawn* separate journey branches?",
    "which journey paths should be *visualized* first for greatest clarity?",
    "which cross-stage patterns should be *highlighted* to reveal bottlenecks or accelerators?"
  ]
},
focus: {
  concept: null,
  context: { goal: "design a reusable envision question set for mapping a product journey" }
}

### üß© runtime reuse ‚Äî plugging in case specifics

**scenario**
A SaaS startup is mapping the journey for their **new AI-driven analytics platform**.

**runtime inputs**
- The **devtime kit** stays the same.
- Case-specific facts are added to `focus.context`:
\`\`\`ts
focus: {
  concept: null,
  context: {
    goal: "map product journey for AI analytics SaaS",
    target_segments: ["SMB owners", "mid-level data analysts"],
    launch_region: "North America",
    constraint: "initial onboarding must complete within 15 minutes",
    success_metric: "conversion to paid within 14 days"
  }
}
\`\`\`

**runtime application**
- **Contextualize** questions adapted to case:
  - First awareness moment? ‚Üí *LinkedIn ad or industry blog review*.
  - Stage touchpoints? ‚Üí *ad ‚Üí landing page ‚Üí signup ‚Üí guided setup ‚Üí dashboard insights*.
  - Constraints? ‚Üí *must integrate with Google Sheets in setup*.
  - Stage success signals? ‚Üí *dashboard accessed 3+ times in week 1*.

- **Conceptualize** questions to frame mapping:
  - Segment split? ‚Üí *separate flows for SMB owners vs analysts*.
  - Visualize first? ‚Üí *SMB owner‚Äôs full journey to paid plan*.
  - Cross-stage bottlenecks? ‚Üí *handoff from setup to first insights*.

**runtime result**
- Journey map drafted with two parallel flows.
- Bottleneck identified: **delay in generating first insights**.
- Next iteration: add onboarding tweak to surface sample insights instantly.

---

### üîÅ why this split (devtime ‚Üí runtime) is valuable
- **Framework stability**: devtime kit ensures every journey map starts with full stage coverage.
- **Efficiency**: runtime mapping skips reinvention, focuses on populating specifics.
- **Comparability**: journeys across products share the same backbone, making patterns visible.
- **Scalability**: improvements to the kit (e.g., adding ‚Äúadvocacy‚Äù stage) propagate to all future mappings.
