# 🧩 .brief: `<diverge> ↔ <cluster>`

## .what
the **duality** between `<diverge>` and `<cluster>` describes a **complementary motion of thought**:
- `<diverge>` expands a concept outward into **maximum variance instances**
- `<cluster>` contracts many instances inward into **coherent groupings**

together they form a **push–pull dynamic** of exploration and organization.

---

## 🎯 purpose
- balance **creativity and clarity**: generate wide variety, then refine into structure
- ensure **coverage and coherence**: divergence prevents blind spots, clustering prevents overload
- support **iterative cycles of insight**: each informs and strengthens the other

---

## ⚙️ motion
1. **<diverge>**
   - spread focus to surface **differences, alternatives, and variations**
   - motion is centrifugal — outward, increasing breadth

2. **<cluster>**
   - compress focus to reveal **patterns, affinities, and themes**
   - motion is centripetal — inward, increasing coherence

---

## 🔄 interplay
- divergence without clustering → noise, endless fragments, lack of synthesis
- clustering without divergence → rigidity, premature convergence, missed options
- **dual-cycle**:
  1. diverge to gather possibilities
  2. cluster to extract structure
  3. repeat as needed, each cycle sharper

---

## 📐 metaphor
- `<diverge>` = scattering seeds across a field
- `<cluster>` = harvesting them into sheaves
- the **crop of thought** emerges only through both motions in rhythm
