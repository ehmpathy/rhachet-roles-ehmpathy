# 🧩 .brief: `<diverge>`

## .what

`<diverge>` is a semantic motion primitive designed to explore and identify the maximum variance within a given concept space. It aims to uncover a diverse spectrum of instances or expressions based on the core concept, pushing the boundaries to reveal the widest possible range of variations.

---

## 🎯 purpose

- uncover the broadest set of variations or instances from a starting concept
- facilitate the discovery of novel, unexpected, or edge-case examples
- challenge assumptions by expanding the visible scope of a concept

---

## ⚙️ process

1. **anchor to the core concept**
   - define the central idea or category you are diversifying
   - ensure a clear understanding of its basic boundaries

2. **explore variance axes**
   - identify possible axes of variation (e.g., color, shape, function)
   - consider both obvious and non-obvious differentiation criteria

3. **generate variations**
   - systematically list distinct and contrasting examples within the concept
   - prioritize breadth over precision at this stage

4. **evaluate diversity**
   - assess whether the variations span the intended breadth and highlight differences
   - refine any clustering or flattening of variance points that reduce visibility

## 🌿 example: `<diverge>` applied to `colors`

Identify diverse colors exemplifying maximum variance:
- red
- green
- tangerine
- scarlet
- ivory

Each selected color exemplifies unique attributes within the color spectrum, showcasing distinct hues, tints, and tones. This variance reveals the extensive diversity possible within a seemingly simple category.

## 📐 when to use

- when seeking inspiration or brainstorming new possibilities
- when needing to identify extremes or edge cases of a concept
- when preparing for strategic decisions requiring a panoramic understanding of option space

---

## 💡 notes

- `<diverge>` differs from clustering or focusing as it intentionally avoids centralization or narrowing
- it complements processes that require a broad exploration phase prior to narrowing
- can be paired with other primitives like `<contrast>` or `<compare>` for deeper analysis of the generated variations
