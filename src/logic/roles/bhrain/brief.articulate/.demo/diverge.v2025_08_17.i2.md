# üß© .brief: `<diverge>`

## .what
**`<diverge>`** is a semantic motion primitive focused on exploring the breadth of a given concept by identifying its most varied instances. It operates by systematically uncovering diverse elements or variations within the same conceptual category, highlighting the range of possibilities that exist.

---

## üéØ purpose
- to map out and understand the **full spectrum of a concept**
- to enrich the concept by identifying and articulating its **maximum variance instances**
- to facilitate creative thinking and ideation by exposing **all possible angles**

---

## üó∫ method
1. **identify the core concept**
   - determine the central idea or category you wish to explore
   - e.g., `colors`, `solutions`, `approaches`

2. **expand into variants**
   - list out as many distinct and varied instances as possible
   - focus on range and contrast, covering different attributes, usages, or contexts

3. **categorize variance**
   - consider organizing instances by subcategories or dimensions of variance
   - e.g., for colors: hue, tone, saturation

4. **integrate divergent discovery**
   - apply findings to broaden perspectives or inform decisions in related activities
   - e.g., using the diverse color palette to design inclusive artwork

## üîç examples
- `<diverge>[colors]` results in a range:
  - `red`, `green`, `tangerine`, `scarlet`, `ivory`
- `<diverge>[cooking methods]` could produce:
  - `baking`, `grilling`, `steaming`, `frying`, `poaching`
- `<diverge>[musical genres]` may uncover:
  - `jazz`, `classical`, `hip-hop`, `electronic`, `folk`

---

## üí° notes
- `<diverge>` is about **breadth over depth**, emphasizing range rather than detail
- useful in ideation sessions, diversification strategies, and exploratory research
- pairs well with `<converge>` to then refine or select from the expanded set of instances
