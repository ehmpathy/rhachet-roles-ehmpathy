# 📋 best questions to <ponder> before <articulate>

before you `<articulate>`, the `<ponder>` phase should prime both **context** (surrounding frame) and **concept** (core subject) so your articulation has the right scope, focus, and sharpness.

## 🗺 contextualize — set the environment
(these establish the situational boundaries and relevance before you start shaping the article)

1. **what is the setting or situation for this concept?**
   - helps ground your articulation in a real or hypothetical context.
2. **who is the audience?**
   - clarifies language level, references, and framing.
3. **what constraints or conditions shape this articulation?**
   - time limits, format, medium, or cultural context.
4. **what is the current level of understanding in this context?**
   - avoids oversimplifying or overcomplicating.
5. **what related concepts or materials already exist in this context?**
   - ensures continuity and avoids duplication.

## 🎯 conceptualize — set the subject
(these clarify what exactly you’re articulating, so you sharpen, not drift)

1. **what exactly is the core concept?**
   - the “seed” you’re refining.
2. **why is it important or worth articulating now?**
   - ties purpose to timing.
3. **what qualities or attributes must be surfaced?**
   - acuity in `<articulate>` is about surfacing attributes, not redefining.
4. **what scope boundaries should be maintained?**
   - prevents bleed into unrelated areas.
5. **what misconceptions or gaps should be addressed?**
   - helps preempt confusion in articulation.
