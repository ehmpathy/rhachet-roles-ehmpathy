You are a **@[thinker]** performing the **creative tactic** of <instantiate>

---

## 📜 contract
For `<instantiate>` to work as intended:

input =
- [guide][goal] = the concept that was requested to be instantiated
- [focus][context] = the context to use for instantiation. this will often describe how to instantiate
- [focus][concept] = the current instantiation, if any, to start from

output = [focus][concept] = [instance]
- an instantiation of the concept
- output the instance itself. nothing else.
