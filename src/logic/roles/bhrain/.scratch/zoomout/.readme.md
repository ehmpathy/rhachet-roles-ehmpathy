# ðŸ§  verb: `<zoomout>`

## what

`<zoomout>` is a **thought operation** used to expand the frame of reference around a specific [thing]
â€” revealing its surrounding **system**, **roles**, **dependencies**, and **purpose**.

It moves the thinker **up the abstraction stack**, translating a focused instance into its **structural**, **systemic**, or **meta** form.
It also **reconnects that instance to the motive** that makes it matter.

---

## why

Use `<zoomout>` to:

- understand **how a part fits into the whole**
- surface **hidden actors, flows, or constraints**
- clarify **why** this [thing] exists (its motive)
- enable better **planning**, **prioritization**, or **refactoring**
- prepare for operations like `<cluster>`, `<distill>`, or `<triage>`
- generalize from a detail to a reusable pattern

---

## how

Given a focused [thing] (e.g. a step, object, rule, or interaction),
`<zoomout>` performs the following:

1. **Identify its enclosing system**
   â†’ what process, journey, or domain is this part of?

2. **Expose the roles involved**
   â†’ who are the actors that interact with it?

3. **Reveal linked artifacts and state**
   â†’ what objects or resources are affected or required?

4. **Locate it within a timeline or flow**
   â†’ where does this happen relative to other steps?

5. **Surface motives and consequences**
   â†’ why does this happen, and what does it enable or block?

6. **Ascend abstraction levels**
   â†’ shift from instance â†’ structure â†’ system â†’ grammar

7. **Bind to motive**
   â†’ who wants this [thing], and what pressure or desire drives its existence?

## abstraction travel

| abstraction level | focus                      | example                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **concrete**      | specific instance / detail | "customer clicks â€˜book nowâ€™ button"    |
| **structural**    | pattern or mechanism       | "customer requests an appointment"     |
| **systemic**      | flow or process            | "user.journey from discovery to booking" |
| **meta**          | framework or grammar       | "journeys are composed of steps and roles" |

â†’ `<zoomout>` is the **upward movement** across these levels.
â†’ `<zoomin>` is its downward inverse.

## example

\`\`\`txt
input:
  [thing] = @[customer] <set> [appointment].status = requested

<zoomout>(thing) â‡’

zoomed-out view:
  - system: part of `user.journey` from exploration â†’ fulfillment
  - roles: @[customer], @[provider], system
  - upstream: <get> [appointable]
  - downstream: @[provider] <set> approval
  - artifacts: [appointment], [reservation], [notification]
  - motive:
      - @[customer] wants service at a convenient time
      - @[provider] wants to fill schedule with minimal friction
      - system wants to match demand to availability efficiently
  - abstraction:
      - structural: appointment request step
      - systemic: booking flow
      - meta: actor-verb-artifact grammar
\`\`\`

---

## use cases

- zooming out on a UI action to understand backend implications
- zooming out on a term to reveal systemic role
- zooming out on a rule to expose policy logic
- zooming out on a component to refactor its boundaries
- zooming out on a pattern to generalize or reapply
- zooming out on a behavior to explain its motive

---

## related verbs

- `<zoomin>` â€” tighten focus on a part of a system
- `<cluster>` â€” group related items once zoomed out
- `<distill>` â€” extract the essence from the zoomed-out structure
- `<triage>` â€” prioritize within the context surfaced by zooming out

---

## prompt template

\`\`\`txt
you are a **@[thinker]** skilled at `<zoomout>`.

your task is to:
1. reveal the system this [thing] lives in
2. name the roles and artifacts it depends on or affects
3. locate its position in a sequence or flow
4. surface the motive and downstream consequences
5. shift it up the abstraction stack:
   from instance â†’ structure â†’ system â†’ meta

return a `zoomed-out view` of the original [thing] across these levels, including motive.
