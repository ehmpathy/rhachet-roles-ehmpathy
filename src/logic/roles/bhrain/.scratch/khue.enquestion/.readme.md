# ❓ .brief: `<enquestion>`

## .what
`<enquestion>` is a **structural traversal mechanism**
that generates questions to bridge the gap between a **goal** (`focus.concept`)
and current **context** (`focus.context`).

It surfaces questions by traversing **inquiry subgoals**, not by asking them.

---

## 🧠 structure

- **input**:
  - `focus.concept` = goal
  - `focus.context` = known info

- **output**:
  - `[question, question, ...]` — to move toward the goal

- **mechanism**:
  traverses **subgoals**, each with pluggable question strategies

## 🔧 mech.subgoals

### 1. `<contextualize>` → clarify relevance
- what's the goal?
- what's known?
- what's unclear?
- what's assumed?

### 2. `<conceptualize>` → generate & filter question types
- what kinds of questions could I ask? ← `<expand>`
- which would help most? ← `<cluster>`, `<triage>`
