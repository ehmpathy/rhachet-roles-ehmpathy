.idea =
  - Develop a scheduling system for home services that allows neighbors to book appointments with service providers automatically.
  - Keywords: scheduling, automation, appointments, home services, bookings

.scope =
  - In Scope: Setting reservable work hours, syncing with external calendars, booking appointments, approving or rejecting appointments, retrieving appointments.
  - Out of Scope: Payment gateway integration, user account management, notifications outside direct scheduling.

.intent =
  - To streamline the appointment booking process for home service providers and their clients by enabling automated scheduling and calendar management.

.confusion =
  - The roles of providers and customers were intertwined without clear boundaries, and the integration with external systems wasnâ€™t fully described.
  - It wasn't clear if the focus was only on scheduling or if it included full service management.

.rewrite =
  - A system that allows home service providers to define available hours and automatically sync with external calendars to display and manage available appointments for clients.
  - Alternatively: Enable home service providers to efficiently manage bookings via automated scheduling, allowing clients to self-select available times, with options for automatic approval or manual confirmation.
  - Alternative framing: Implement a scheduling solution where clients can independently book, view, and manage service appointments, with service providers having control over availability and appointment approvals.
