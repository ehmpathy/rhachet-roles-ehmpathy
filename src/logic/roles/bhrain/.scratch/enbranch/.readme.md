### `<enbranch>` — divergent idea exploration

**.what**
`<enbranch>` identifies and explores distinct branches of thought that stem from a given motive or question.
It generates a set of divergent ideas — each representing a unique direction or interpretation.

To effectively explore an idea space, it’s essential to surface multiple possible approaches before converging on a solution.
`<enbranch>` enables this by producing a variety of options, increasing the chance of discovering novel or valuable paths.
