# ðŸ§© <cluster> â€” group similar items to reveal structure

---

## .what

**<cluster>** is an operation that groups similar items into distinct [cluster]s based on shared traits, patterns, or purposes.

Each resulting [cluster]:
- contains items that are **internally cohesive**
- is **externally distinct** from other clusters
- may be named or labeled to reflect its core theme

This operation can be manual (rule-based) or automatic (semantic, categorical, etc).

---

## .why

Use <cluster> to:
- reduce cognitive load by organizing many items into coherent groups
- surface latent patterns, themes, or categories within messy data
- prepare for downstream operations like <triage>, <distill>, or <compare>
- enable structured communication or decision-making by creating buckets of meaning

Clustering transforms **raw plurality** into **actionable structure**.

---

## .when

Use <cluster> when:
- you have **many similar items** (e.g. >5) and they are **not yet organized**
- you want to **understand**, **prioritize**, or **summarize** complex data
- you are about to **grade**, **distill**, or **navigate** sets of ideas or usecases
- youâ€™re designing UX, product flows, or narratives and need **thematic groupings**

Avoid <cluster> if:
- the items are too few to meaningfully separate
- dissimilarity or sequence matters more than similarity

---

## .fit â€” is <cluster> a good fit for LLMs?

yes. LLMs are well-suited for <cluster> when the items involve natural language, user intent, or conceptual patterns.

they excel at:
- detecting **semantic similarity** beyond surface wording
- clustering by **role**, **motive**, or **grammar**
- **naming and explaining** each cluster
- adapting to **different framings** (e.g., by actor, verb, drive)

however, LLMs are less ideal for:
- **numeric or vector-based** clustering
- **large-scale datasets** requiring strict reproducibility

use <cluster> with LLMs when structure, meaning, or explanation is more valuable than algorithmic precision.
