# ðŸ§  `<envision>` an [idea]

## .what
**<envision>** is the act of vividly imagining a potential [idea] â€” a structure, behavior, or scenario â€” as if it were real.

you use `<envision>` to bring an abstract [idea] into clarity by simulating how it might look, feel, or function in the world. this may include:

- walking through how it operates
- seeing it from the actorâ€™s point of view
- imagining the effects it would cause
- exploring its constraints or edge cases

## .why
- to **develop** a vague concept into something actionable
- to **test** whether an idea makes sense in context
- to **anticipate** side effects or emergent properties
- to **communicate** a design, feature, or behavior clearly
- to **compare** variants before building anything

## .when to use
- at early idea stages to expand and test feasibility
- after divergence, before commitment
- when needing stakeholder or team alignment
- as a creative or analytical tool to pressure-test ideas

## .inputs
- [idea] â€” the seed or concept to be envisioned
- [context] â€” relevant constraints, actors, and motives
- @[caller]{motive} â€” what you hope to understand or achieve

## .output
a fully formed [idea] with:
- clarified mechanics or flow
- specific actors and outcomes
- imagined scenarios or edge cases
- artifacts (e.g., diagrams, mock flows, timelines) if applicable
