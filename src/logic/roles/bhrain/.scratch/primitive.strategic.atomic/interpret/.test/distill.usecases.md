[narrative] 🫧 =
The caller aims to systematically gather at least 21 use cases within one day. After identifying and collecting them, they intend to cluster these use cases into groups based on similarities. Finally, the goal is to distill and triage these clusters into a focused and key set of up to 5 use cases for clarity and focus.
