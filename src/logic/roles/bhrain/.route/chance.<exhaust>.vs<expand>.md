so,
- <expand> = <diverge> -> <collect>
- <exhaust> = <loop>(repeatee=<expand>, until=<converge>)


      <exhaust>
        └─ <loop>
            ├─ <expand>
            │    ├─ <diverge>
            │    └─ <collect>
            └─ until <converge>

we'll save <exhaust> for later, due to <converge> likely being a tough one to gauge for now
