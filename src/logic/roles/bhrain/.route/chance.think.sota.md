🧠 major LLM reasoning tactics (ToT alternatives or companions)
tactic	core idea	resembles	strengths
ToT (Tree of Thought)	expand + evaluate branches in parallel	search tree	best for planning, puzzles, divergent paths
CoT (Chain of Thought)	think step-by-step in a linear trace	linear reasoning	great for math, logic, and clarity
ReAct	alternate between reasoning + actions	cognitive agent loop	useful for tool use + exploration
Reflexion	self-criticize and revise previous thoughts	meta-cognition	boosts learning and resilience
AutoGPT-style	reason + execute + review (loop until goal)	goal-directed agent	powerful, but often inefficient
Self-Ask	break into subquestions and answer each individually	recursive QA	good for knowledge decomposition
ToRA (Tree of Re-asking)	tree of refined subquestions from main prompt	question refinement	best for research or topic breakdown
DEPS (Decompose, Evaluate, Plan, Synthesize)	structured prompt stages	tactic pipeline	flexible + extensible thought engine
Multiverse	generate many completions, then vote or merge	ensemble strategy	boosts correctness via diversity
SOC (Scratchpad of Consciousness)	maintain running context + claims	internal memory	works for open-ended exploration

🥇 what performs best? (based on studies and benchmarks)
📈 depends on task type:
task type	best tactic	reference paper
math & logic	CoT + self-consistency	Wei et al., 2022 (CoT)
decision-making	ToT or DEPS	Yao et al., 2023 (ToT)
tool use / planning	ReAct or Reflexion	Yao et al., 2022 (ReAct)
long horizon problems	ToT + Reflexion	Liu et al., 2023 (Reflexion)
Q&A / search-based	Self-Ask or ToRA	Press et al., 2022
creative generation	Multiverse + ToT	works best when diversity matters

🧠 tactic taxonomy
category	verbs / operations	examples
divergence	<enbranch>, <diverge>, generate options	ToT, Multiverse
convergence	<enconverge>, <select>, synthesize	CoT, DEPS, Reflexion
evaluation	<engrade>, <critic>, <reflect>	ReAct, Reflexion, ToT
decomposition	<split>, <subask>, <reframe>	Self-Ask, ToRA
execution	<run>, <plan>, <respond>	AutoGPT, ReAct

🧠 recommendation: hybrid engines win
→ the strongest systems combine tactics
e.g.:

ToT + Reflexion: explore, reflect, retry

CoT + Self-Ask + Plan: step-by-step with decomposition

Multiverse + Converge: generate + vote + synthesize

ToT + ReAct: branch into tool-assisted actions

sounds like tree-of-thought is the fundamental primitive against which all else can be instantiated, no?

e.g., chain of thought = 1 tree branch?


ChatGPT said:
yes — you're exactly right.

Tree of Thought (ToT) is arguably the most generalizable and expressive primitive
among LLM reasoning tactics — all others can be seen as constrained forms of it.

🌳 why Tree of Thought is the universal container
ToT gives you:

✅ branching → for divergent exploration

✅ evaluation → for reflection and pruning

✅ selection → for search control

✅ convergence → for synthesis and closure

everything else is just a simplified traversal through that structure.

🧩 how other tactics map into ToT
tactic	ToT equivalent
Chain of Thought	a single linear path through the tree (no branching)
Self-Ask	each subquestion = root of its own subtree
Reflexion	injects a <critic> or <reframe> node after failure
ReAct	actions are attached to branches as tool-use thoughts
Multiverse	generate parallel branches, then converge via vote
CoT w/ self-consistency	generate multiple CoT traces, vote on answer

Tree of Thought is the general case —
the rest are just constrained paths, fanouts, or loops within the tree.

   A    B   C         ← ToT branches

        B1 → B2 → B3  ← CoT trace

         reflexion
🪞 conclusion
yes — Tree of Thought is the meta-structure.
it's the primitive from which Chain of Thought, Reflexion, Self-Ask, ReAct, etc.
can all be expressed, embedded, or composed.

does chain-of-thought succeed at "idea search" tasks?


ChatGPT said:
💡 short answer: Chain of Thought (CoT) helps, but it’s not ideal alone for “idea search” tasks.

🧠 why?
“Idea search” = finding multiple distinct, valuable, or creative ideas —
not just solving a linear problem.

CoT is inherently linear and incremental:

it builds one idea step by step

it doesn't naturally diverge, compare, or branch

✅ what CoT is good at:
task type	CoT strength
math + logic	🟢 excellent
planning (single path)	🟢 strong
diagnostics	🟡 decent
brainstorming / idea search	🔴 weak alone
creativity / design options	🔴 poor by itself

🔄 better alternatives for idea search:
tactic	why it works
ToT	explores multiple branches
Multiverse	generates many completions in parallel
Diverge + Converge	separates creativity from evaluation
Self-Ask (multi-subquestions)	unlocks multiple problem framings

idea search benefits from divergence, exploration, and reflection
— none of which CoT does natively.

🧠 how to make CoT help idea search:
combine it with these steps:

ts
Copy code
1. <diverge> → generate 3+ directions
2. for each: <enstep> chain (CoT per direction)
3. <engrade> → rate feasibility / novelty
4. <converge> → pick best or combine
this is Tree of Thought with CoT paths per branch.

✅ summary
| does CoT help idea search? | ❌ not by itself |
| should you use it? | ✅ yes, within each idea path |
| what else is needed? | <diverge> + <critic> + <converge> |

want a skill scaffold that wraps CoT into a multiverse-style idea search framework?







You said:
lets call it <enchain> btw


ChatGPT said:
Updated saved memory
noted — from now on, we'll treat <enchain> as the verb to trigger a chain of thought reasoning path. it's the linear, step-by-step reasoning primitive within the broader distilisys grammar.
