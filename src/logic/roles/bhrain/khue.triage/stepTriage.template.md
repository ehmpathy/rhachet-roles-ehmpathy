# 🗣️ prompt: `<triage>` — prioritize and sort concepts by guiding questions

You are a **@[thinker]** performing the **prioritization tactic** `<triage>`.

---

## 📜 contract
For `<triage>` to work as intended:

input = [seed][concepts]
- a **list of concepts** (tasks, ideas, issues, or elements) to be triaged
- the list may be long, unordered, and heterogeneous

output = [prioritized][concepts]
- the same concepts, but **sorted and grouped by priority grades derived from context**
- **every placed concept must include a concise rationale** explaining *why* it belongs in that grade, referencing the guiding questions/criteria
- if the input is not a list, simply output:
  `"BadRequestError: input must be a list of concepts"`

**why this contract exists:**
- triage is a **question-driven process**; prioritization only makes sense relative to guiding criteria
- a **context-dependent grading scale** keeps results faithful to domain constraints
- attaching a **rationale** to each placement makes decisions transparent, reviewable, and improvable

---

## ⚙️ method
1. **anchor to the seed concepts**
   - parse and restate the full set of concepts needing triage
   - confirm the scope of assessment (what kinds of concepts are included)

2. **establish criteria (via guiding questions)**
   - identify the **key questions** that define the triage dimensions
   - e.g., “which are most urgent?”, “which yield the highest impact?”, “which are prerequisites?”, “which are low-effort/high-gain?”

3. **derive a grading scale from context**
   - synthesize **grade names** from the criteria and environment (examples: `critical`, `urgent`, `near_term`, `strategic`, `defer`, etc.)
   - prefer **3–5 distinct grades** that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive for the current context
   - order grades from highest to lowest priority

4. **evaluate and sort with rationale**
   - for each concept:
     - place it under exactly one grade
     - provide a **rationale**: a crisp, criteria-referenced explanation (impact, urgency, dependency, risk, effort, alignment)

5. **review and refine**
   - merge duplicates, clarify ambiguous items
   - verify no concept is added/removed relative to the input
   - ensure rationales are specific (avoid generic statements)

---

## 📐 output format
- Return **only** a JSON object of the shape:

\`\`\`json
{
  "$grade": [
    { "item": "<exact input concept>", "rationale": "<why this grade, tied to criteria>" }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

- **`$grade` keys** must be **derived from the context and guiding questions** (not hard-coded).
- **Every array entry** must be an object with **`item`** and **`rationale`**.
- **Only use items from the input list**; do **not** invent new concepts.
- Do **not** include any other text, formatting, or commentary before or after the JSON.
