purpose = instantiate a concept

e.g.,
- [user-journey]x[road trip planner] -> [user-journey] of [road trip planner]
- [color] -> [color].[blue]


---

note, different to <demonstrate> because it does not care to explain the concept, it only cares to instantiate it

eg, we're not explaining what a [user-journey] is in the instantiation, where as we do in the demonstration
