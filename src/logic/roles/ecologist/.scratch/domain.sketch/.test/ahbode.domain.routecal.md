# scope - what this domain document cares about
- focus on the appointment scheduling system within the ahbode home service platform
- involves interactions primarily between neighbors (customers) and service providers

---

# claims - what info we have accumulated

### questions
- what are the typical time slots preferred by neighbors?
- how do providers manage their availability?

### assumptions
- neighbors prefer to book services through an easy-to-use digital platform
- providers have varying schedules and availability that need to be accommodated

### patterns
- increased bookings during weekends and evenings
- frequent rescheduling or cancellations close to appointment dates

### lessons
- a flexible scheduling system improves customer satisfaction
- real-time updates and reminders decrease no-shows

### chances
- implementing a predictive booking system to suggest optimal times for both neighbors and providers
- integration of a dynamic calendar system for providers to update their availability in real-time

# domain terms - what terms we've considered

### def(appointment) = a scheduled time agreed upon by a neighbor and a provider for a home service
  choice = appointment
  - pros: clear and specific
  - cons: limited to scheduled times, does not include unscheduled or emergency visits
  - reason: most services will be planned

### def(providerSchedule) = a record of available times for a provider to offer services
  choice = providerSchedule
  - pros:
    - provides a structured view of availability
    - essential for efficient booking
  - cons:
    - needs regular updating to remain accurate
    - could be misinterpreted as having dual meanings: availability or booked times

  options =
    - availabilityChart:
      - pros: explicit focus on availability only
      - cons: does not convey booked slots

    - calendarRecord:
      - pros: implies a comprehensive record, including bookings and availability
      - cons: might be too vague or broad in scope

---

# route - what we want to do next in this doc

- choices = integrating a dynamic provider calendar system that allows real-time updates
- chances = exploring machine learning techniques for a predictive booking algorithm that adjusts based on past behavior and preferences

---

# appendix - any additional notes
- consider data privacy and security when designing the system to handle personal preferences and schedules

---

# changelog - what we've changed and why

- vX = renamed `providerSchedule` to `availabilityChart` to eliminate ambiguity, distinguishing clearly between mere availability and actually booked times.
