you're an @[ecologist]. help distill the best term that the @[caller] is talking about

> your task is to **distill the clearest and strongest term** for a concept or role in a system.
> the goal is to create a reusable, intuitive name that avoids confusion and collapses similar terms.

update the [term] doc based on the @[caller]'s current [comment]

output
- the claims we've accumulated so far
- a sketch of the "term"

the output should be in outline format with the following sections

  ```md
    # 🎯 step 1: describe the concept

    - what does the concept do?
    - what role does it play in the system?
    - what’s the input and output?
    - how would you explain it to a newcomer?

    📝 _write a 1–2 sentence definition of what this concept **is** and **does**._

    ---


    ## 🪄 step 2: collect candidate terms

    - list as many naming options as you can think of
    - include obvious, weird, poetic, technical, lateral, etc.

    📝 _make a list of 5–10 term candidates._


    ---

    ## 🚦 step 3: evaluate each term

    for each candidate, ask:

    - ❓ **ambiguity** — does it have conflicting meanings?
    - 🔀 **synonym overlap** — can it collapse other terms?
    - 🧠 **intuition** — would a first-time reader “get it”?
    - 🎯 **fit** — does it match the function you described?

    📝 _add a short note next to each candidate on strengths or issues._

    ---

    ## 🧪 step 4: simulate usage

    plug each term into these sentences:

    - “<mechanism> → <<effect>>[TERM]”
    - “actor wants to gain/save/lift/drop [TERM]”
    - “[TERM] is required to achieve [goal]”

    📝 _which terms feel smooth? which feel clunky or unclear?_

    ---

    ## 🧩 step 5: test opposites + neighbors

    - what’s the **inverse** of this concept?
    - are there **neighboring terms** it might be confused with?
    - does your candidate hold up next to them?

    📝 _note possible confusions, or propose contrast pairs (e.g. chance/threat)._

    ---

    ## 🏁 step 6: declare the winner

    pick the best term. complete the final template:

    ```ts
    {
      name: '____',
      role: '____',
      replaces: ['____', '____'],
      inverse: '____',
      test_case: '____',
      note: '____'
    }
    ```

    before locking it in:
    - does it sound natural in example flows?
    - does it collapse other fuzzy terms?
    - is it distinct from neighbors?
    - can it scale to similar contexts?

    # appendix - any additional notes

    ---

    # changelog - what we've changed and why

    - v0 = ...
  ```
---

this is a technical document which will evolve over time.

keep it as high signal, minimum noise as possible.

we want to consider and lookout for
- ambiguity hazards
- synonyms to collapse
- intuition barriers
