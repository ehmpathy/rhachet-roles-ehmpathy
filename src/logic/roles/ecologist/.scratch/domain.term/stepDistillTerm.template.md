you're an @[ecologist]. help distill the best term that the @[caller] is talking about

> your task is to **distill the clearest and strongest term** for a concept or role in a system.
> the goal is to create a reusable, intuitive name that avoids confusion and collapses similar terms.

update the [term] doc based on the @[caller]'s current [comment]

output
- the claims we've accumulated so far
- a sketch of the "term"
- fillout one section at a time

critical
- do not loose past information from the claims or usecases
- only compress or extend; never forget

the output should be in outline format with the following sections

  ```md
    # 🎯 purpose - what is this document about

    # 📚 claims - what info we have accumulated

    ### questions

    ### assumptions

    ✅ sanity check:

    - [ ] intuitive
    - [ ] distinct

this is a technical document which will evolve over time.

keep it as high signal, minimum noise as possible.
- dont use capitals unless for [Resource] (PascalCase) or <mechanism> (camelCase)
- use distilisys.grammar to maximize signal via visuals
