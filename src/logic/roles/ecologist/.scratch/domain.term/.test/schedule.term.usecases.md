# ðŸŽ¯ purpose - what is this document about

to gather and refine use cases and feedback related to the usage and understanding of the term __TERM__ within scheduling and availability contexts.

---

# ðŸ“š claims - what info we have accumulated

### questions

- what terms best capture the concept of a provider's available time slots, which include unbooked times and times potentially flexible for rescheduling?
- what mechanisms should be in place to notify providers and neighbors about sudden changes in __TERM__?
- how can the system ensure privacy and data integrity while managing the __TERM__?

### assumptions

- times marked as available are not necessarily free of appointments but are periods a provider is willing to be booked or rescheduled.
- providers and neighbors are willing to use a centralized system to manage and view scheduling information.

### patterns

- distinction between fixed external commitments and flexible bookings within the system is crucial to avoid scheduling conflicts.
- providers require a system to clearly distinguish between external events and internal potential bookings to manage their schedules effectively.

### lessons

- flexible scheduling within an internal system must be well integrated with immutable external calendars to maintain accurate and efficient booking processes.
- ensure any updates to __TERM__ are reliably communicated to all parties involved to prevent scheduling conflicts.
- use the term @[neighbor] instead of @[client] to align language with neighborhood-focused engagements.

# ðŸ“Œ usecases

### âœ… positive - usecases when we leverage the term

> specific examples of when we need the __TERM__, to <<gain>>[precision]
> minimum of 3 required, maximum of 10 recommended

ðŸ“Œ case.p1 = manage __TERM__ across platforms
  .who = @[provider]
  .what = @[provider]<set> "availability"
    - adjust time blocks deemed available for service across different scheduling platforms
    - clarify time slots flexible for internal adjustments
  .why =
    - motive.1 = avoid clashes with external commitments
    - motive.2 = optimize schedule for increased bookings
  .examples =
    - example.1 = provider blocks out vacation days on external calendar while marking other days as available in the system for booking or rescheduling.

ðŸ“Œ case.p2 = integrate __TERM__ with external calendars
  .who = @[provider]
  .what = @[provider]<pull> "external calendar events"
    - dynamically fetch external calendar data
    - adjust internal availability based on new external information
  .why =
    - motive.1 = ensure a unified and accurate reflection of availability
    - motive.2 = update availability more accurately for neighbors
  .examples =
    - example.1 = provider pulls external event like a conference day and updates internal scheduling tool to block out those hours.

ðŸ“Œ case.p3 = get appointment options
  .who = @[neighbor]
  .what = @[neighbor]<get> "provider's availability"
    - browse through potential booking times
    - select an optimal time that aligns with personal availability and providerâ€™s offerings
  .why =
    - motive.1 = maximize convenience by aligning provider-neighbor schedules
    - motive.2 = enhance system usability and efficiency
  .examples =
    - example.1 = neighbor views providerâ€™s __TERM__ to schedule a meeting during mutually available times without conflicts.

ðŸ“Œ case.p4 = set appointment request
  .who = @[neighbor]
  .what = @[neighbor]<set> "appointment request"
    - request must match provider's available times
    - appointment is validated and instantiated against original availability
  .why =
    - motive.1 = ensure requests align with true availability
    - motive.2 = prevent overbooking and conflicts
  .examples =
    - example.1 = neighbor sends a request during free time shown in __TERM__, system confirms and books the slot.

### ðŸ›‘ negative - usecases when a different term is needed

> specific examples of when we avoid __TERM__, to <<drop>>[confusion]
> minimum of 1 required, maximum of 10 recommended

ðŸ“Œ case.n1 = differentiate from non-negotiable events
  .who = @[provider]
  .what = @[provider]<get> "immutable external commitments"
    - refer to events that cannot be changed or influenced by the internal scheduling system
    - include fixed external commitments like statutory holidays, personal events, or any commitment not manageable through the service platform
  .why =
    - motive.1 = establish clarity between fixed external commitments and adjustable internal __TERM__
    - motive.2 = avoid confusion and scheduling conflicts for both providers and neighbors
  .examples =
    - example.1 = provider marks a public holiday as off, ensuring it doesnâ€™t show up as available in __TERM__.

# ðŸ“Ž appendix (optional)

> deeper traces, example flows, or edge notes

- consideration about situations where __TERM__ might need to accommodate sudden cancellations or emergency slots, enhancing flexibility and responsiveness in booking systems.
