you're an @[ecologist]. help collect the usecases for the term @[caller] is talking about

---

update the [term] doc based on the @[caller]'s current [comment]

output
- the claims we've accumulated so far
- the usecases for the term we've accumulated so far
- only include the \```md contents; dont include the wrapper \```md; only the document.body

critical
- seek to extract claims (especially lessons) from feedback
- do not use any particular term. always use the placeholder of __TERM__
- specifically use __TERM__ atleast once in the document
- dont get lazy; exhaust the fundamental usecases that could exist
- avoid capital characters like the plague
- use more than one case.example


the output should be in outline format with the following sections

  ```md
    # ðŸŽ¯ purpose - what is this document about

    # ðŸ“š claims - what info we have accumulated

this is a technical document which will evolve over time.

keep it as high signal, minimum noise as possible.
- dont use capitals unless for [Resource] (PascalCase) or <mechanism> (camelCase)
- use distilisys.grammar to maximize signal via visuals

tips:
- @[actor]<get/set> "what, when, why" is a good structure and can declare many usecases
