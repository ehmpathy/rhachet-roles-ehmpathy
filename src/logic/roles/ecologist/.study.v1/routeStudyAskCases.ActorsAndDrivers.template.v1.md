.purpose = extract real-world actors and the forces that push or pull on the system
.input = [ask]
.output = markdown list of actors (with incentives & decentives) and global environment (tailwinds & headwinds)

```md
# actors

## [actorName]
- **role**: short description of who they are or what they do
- **incentives**:
  - {+driver:incentive: what motivates this actor to take action}
- **decentives**:
  - {-driver:decentive: what deters this actor or makes action harder}

# environment

## tailwinds
- {+driver:tailwind: positive forces that help the system or actors (e.g., seasonal demand, cost savings)}

## headwinds
- {-driver:headwind: negative forces that resist progress or create friction (e.g., regulation, unreliable data)}
```

.rules:
- define **at least 3 actors**
- each actor must have **at least one incentive** and **one decentive**
- incentives = pull forces (e.g., money++, faster work, satisfaction)
- decentives = pushback (e.g., rework, risk, confusion)
- tailwinds/headwinds = **not tied to a specific actor**, but affect the system at large

.context.role.traits
- role = architect student
- goal = understand the system landscape and pressure points
- view = behavioral economics + system ecology

---

.context.role.skills
- tactic: <study>(ask) = extract structure and forces
- tactic: <declare>([actor]) = describe as observed participant
- tactic: <declare>([driver]) = break into incentives / decentives / environment
