here's the flow that lead to [appointable], via gpt ui. why is our system unable to get there yet?

      ```
      lets use "reservable" for time that could be reserved;

      i.e., provider.workhours

      if that's the term reservable is assigned, whats a term for "reservable - resercations"


      ChatGPT said:
      perfect — if you define:

      reservable = provider-declared availability (work hours)

      then the term for

      reservable - reservations = actually free, bookable time
      should emphasize both permission and openness.

      ✅ recommended term: open
      why?
      short, intuitive

      widely used in scheduling tools ("open slots")

      implies: “the provider allows it” and “nothing’s blocking it”

      🧩 term structure
      Concept	Term	Meaning
      provider-offered time	reservable	time blocks provider is willing to be booked
      conflict-free within that	open	time blocks still available to reserve
      actual booked time	reservation	time blocks already claimed by someone
      chosen appointment	appointment	reservation + participant + purpose

      📐 formula
      ts
      Copy code
      open = reservable - reservations
      If you want it more descriptive (for internal naming):

      openSlot

      availableSlot

      freeReservable

      unclaimedReservable

      But for most UX and API models, open is the cleanest.

      Would you like this framed visually in a state diagram or JSON model?

      what are some other options? one word, ideally

      here are some one-word alternatives to describe
      reservable - reservations = time that’s allowed and unclaimed:

      ✅ strong candidates
      Term	Pros	Cons
      open	clean, intuitive, used in many scheduling systems	slightly vague in technical contexts
      free	common in calendars (e.g. “free/busy”)	ambiguous (could mean “not busy” even if not reservable)
      vacant	clear, implies unoccupied	slightly clinical or spatial
      unbooked	very literal	slightly clunky, not elegant as a noun
      idle	implies nothing is happening	may suggest passivity, not intent
      clear	clean metaphor (like "clear lane")	not widely used for time
      openable	precise (can be opened/booked)	neologism; not standard
      slot	widely understood in booking systems	needs context (not inherently “free”)
      window	metaphorical and flexible	may be too vague or used elsewhere

      🧠 most intuitive pairings
      reservable	→ open
      declared	→ free
      available	→ vacant
      workingHours	→ unbooked

      💡 my top picks:
      open — cleanest all-purpose

      vacant — precise, implies reservable and free

      free — great if you're aligning with calendar APIs (free/busy)

      unbooked — literal, safest for backend use

      want to pick one based on UX vs code clarity?

      how about a word like "appointmentable"? or a synonym


      ChatGPT said:
      “appointmentable” is understandable but clunky and nonstandard — it sounds a bit like “meeting-speak” and isn’t widely used or elegant. that said, your instinct is right: you want a one-word term that means “can receive an appointment.”

      🔍 viable synonyms or coined alternatives to "appointmentable"
      ✅ cleaner neologisms (best balance of clarity + brevity)
      Term	Notes
      bookable	widely used in booking systems; implies both allowed and unclaimed
      schedulable	slightly more general than bookable; good for internal logic
      appointable	rare but intuitive; feels more natural than “appointmentable”
      claimable	implies availability and action-ready
      slotable	domain-specific, awkward but clear in context
      assignable	implies system-side control, less user-facing
      reserverable	invented, technically precise, but clunky

      🥇 recommended: appointable
      clean neologism

      keeps the same structure as “reservable”

      conveys: “this slot is eligible for becoming an appointment”

      better mouthfeel than "appointmentable"

      🧠 usage example
      ts
      Copy code
      // declared by provider
      reservable: TimeRange[];

      // conflict-free + still available
      appointable: TimeRange[];

      // claimed by user
      appointment: {
        time: TimeRange;
        customer: string;
      }
      would you like a term that’s even more natural-sounding for UI (e.g., "open for booking")? or do you want to stick to systematic 1:1 terms?
