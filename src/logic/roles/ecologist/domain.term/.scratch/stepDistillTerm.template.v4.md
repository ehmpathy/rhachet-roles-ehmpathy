update the [term] doc based on the @[caller]'s current [comment]

output
- the claims we've accumulated so far
- a sketch of the "term"

the output should be in outline format with the following sections

  ```md
   # 🎯 step 1: describe the concept

      - **what it does**:
        _⤷ what behavior or transformation does this enable?_

      - **its system role**:
        _⤷ noun or noun-phrase that describes its identity in context_

      - **input → output**:
        _⤷ what flows through it?_

      - **explanation to newcomer**:
        _⤷ write a 1–2 sentence plain-language description._

      - **usecases it must satisfy**:
        - [ ] usecase.1 = {title}
          - {short sentence or flow}
        - [ ] usecase.2 = ...
        - [ ] usecase.3 = ...

      ---

      ## 🪄 step 2: collect candidate terms

      📝 brainstorm 5–10 contenders. include:
      - literal / domain terms
      - poetic / metaphor terms
      - shorthand / idiomatic forms

      - [ ] candidate.1 = `____`
      - [ ] candidate.2 = `____`
      - [ ] candidate.3 = `____`

      ---

      ## 🚦 step 3: evaluate each term

      📝 for each candidate:

      \`\`\`md
      ### ✅ candidate: `____`

      - ❓ **ambiguity**:
        _does it carry other meanings that could confuse?_

      - 🔀 **synonym fit**:
        _can it replace multiple nearby terms cleanly?_

      - 🧠 **intuition**:
        _would a first-time reader grasp its intent?_

      - 🎯 **role alignment**:
        _does it match the function described in step 1?_

      - 💬 **notes**:
        _connotations, domain usage, etymology, etc._
      \`\`\`

      _repeat this block per term._

      ---

      ## 🧪 step 4: simulate usage

      use these sentence frames:

      - `<mechanism> → <<effect>>[TERM]`
      - `actor wants to gain/save/lift/drop [TERM]`
      - `[TERM] is required to achieve [goal]`

      📝 try each candidate in-context and note which feel:

      - 🌿 smooth
      - ⚠️ clunky
      - ❓ ambiguous

      ---

      ## 🧩 step 5: test opposites + neighbors

      - **inverse concept** (if any):
        _e.g., if this is `gain`, what’s the `loss` version?_

      - **confusable neighbors**:
        _list terms this might be misread as or overlap with_

      - **contrast strategy**:
        _how does this term distinguish itself from those?_

      ---

      ## 🏁 step 6: declare the winner

      final decision snapshot:

      \`\`\`ts
      {
        name: '____',
        role: '____',
        replaces: ['____', '____'],
        inverse: '____',
        test_case: '<mech> → <<effect>>[____]',
        note: '____'
      }
      \`\`\`

      ✅ sanity checklist:

      - [ ] sounds natural in usage
      - [ ] collapses multiple synonyms
      - [ ] distinct from neighbors
      - [ ] intuitive on first contact
      - [ ] scales across usecases listed above

      _(optional: traces, examples, reasoning not captured above)_

      ---

      # changelog – what changed and why

      - v0.1 → term draft initialized
      - v0.2 → renamed from `X` to `Y` to collapse synonyms
      - v0.3 → refined based on intuition barrier around `Z`

  ```

this is a technical document which will evolve over time.

keep it as high signal, minimum noise as possible.

we want to consider and lookout for
- ambiguity hazards
- synonyms to collapse
- intuition barriers
