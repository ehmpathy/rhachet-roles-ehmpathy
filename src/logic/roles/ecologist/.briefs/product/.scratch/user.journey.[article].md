# 🧩 .brief: `[user journey]`

## .what
a **[user journey]** is the structured narrative of a person’s interaction with a product, service, or system over time. it maps the **sequence of steps**, **touchpoints**, and **emotional states** a user experiences while pursuing a specific goal, from first awareness to long-term engagement or exit.

it is both:
- **descriptive** — documenting what actually happens in real-world usage
- **prescriptive** — shaping intended experiences through design decisions

---

## 🎯 goal
- **understand** user behaviors, motivations, and pain points in context
- **optimize** the flow of interactions to improve satisfaction, efficiency, and retention
- **align** cross-functional teams (design, marketing, support, engineering) on a shared experience vision

2. **stages** — major phases in the experience (e.g., awareness, consideration, onboarding, engagement, retention, advocacy)
3. **touchpoints** — specific moments of interaction (digital, physical, or human-mediated)
4. **actions** — what the user does at each stage
5. **thoughts & feelings** — internal perspective driving behavior and response
6. **pain points** — obstacles or frustrations experienced along the way
7. **opportunities** — moments where improvements or innovations can enhance the journey
