### 🧠 topic: ecosystem structure

---

### 🎯 goal
understand what ecosystems are made of, how materials and energy move through them, and how they’re framed in space and time.

---

### 🧩 components of an ecosystem

#### **biotic (living)**
- **producers** – organisms that convert energy (usually sunlight) into biomass (e.g., plants, algae)
- **consumers** – organisms that eat other organisms (herbivores, carnivores, omnivores)
- **decomposers** – organisms that break down dead matter, recycling nutrients (fungi, bacteria, detritivores)

#### **abiotic (non-living)**
- sunlight, temperature, water, soil, air, nutrients — the physical environment that shapes and limits biological processes

---

### 🔄 flows in an ecosystem

#### **energy flow**
- one-way: sun → producers → consumers → decomposers → heat
- governed by inefficiencies: only ~10% of energy moves up each trophic level

#### **material cycling**
- closed loop: atoms (carbon, nitrogen, water, phosphorus) cycle between biotic and abiotic compartments
- driven by biological activity, decomposition, and physical processes

---

### 🗺 scales of analysis

#### **spatial scales**
- **patch** – a small habitat unit (e.g., a pond, a tree)
- **landscape** – a collection of interacting patches
- **biome** – large ecological region shaped by climate (e.g., desert, tundra)

#### **temporal scales**
- **daily** – diurnal patterns (e.g., photosynthesis, foraging)
- **seasonal** – migration, hibernation, breeding cycles
- **successional** – long-term shifts in community structure over years or decades

---

### 🧱 system boundaries

- not always visible or fixed
- may be defined by:
  - topography (e.g., a watershed)
  - biological activity (e.g., range of keystone species)
  - research goals (e.g., plot size in a field study)
- important for clarifying inputs, outputs, and interactions

---

### 🔁 mental model
> an ecosystem is **a dynamic mesh of living and non-living parts**, stitched together by **energy flow** and **material cycles**, and understood across **space and time**.
