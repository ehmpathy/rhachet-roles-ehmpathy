### 🧠 topic: systems thinking in ecology

---

### 🎯 goal
train ecologists to see ecosystems as **interconnected, flow-based systems** — governed by **resource pools**, **biological flows**, and **cyclical feedbacks** that shape system behavior over time.

---

### 🔁 what is systems thinking?

- a framework for understanding **how parts interact** in complex, living systems
- focuses on **relationships, flows, and cycles** instead of isolated events
- asks:
  - what’s accumulating or depleting? (**pools**)
  - what’s moving? (**flows**)
  - what reinforces or stabilizes patterns? (**cycles**)

---

### 🧱 key elements

#### **pools**
- quantities that can build up or run down
  e.g., biomass, soil carbon, water stored in a wetland, total population size

#### **flows**
- processes that transfer material or energy between pools
  e.g., birth, death, migration, photosynthesis, runoff

#### **cycles (feedback loops)**
- **reinforcing cycles** (positive): amplify change
  - e.g., more vegetation → more shade → more moisture → more vegetation
- **balancing cycles** (negative): dampen change
  - e.g., more prey → more predators → fewer prey → fewer predators

ecosystems often contain **nested and competing cycles** that drive both resilience and transformation

---

### 🧠 how to think like a systems ecologist

- follow the **flow paths**, not just the endpoints
- look for **delays, thresholds, and accumulations**
- identify **leverage points** where small changes affect the whole system
- embrace **nonlinear outcomes** and emergent patterns

---

### 🧰 applied tools
- **causal diagrams** – map pools, flows, and cycles visually
- **dynamic models** – simulate changes over time
- **resilience mapping** – understand how systems recover or collapse under pressure

---

### 🔁 mental model
> systems thinking helps ecologists ask:
> “**what’s flowing where, what’s building up, and what cycles are at play?**”
> it’s a shift from describing parts to **understanding living systems as patterns of interaction and change**.
