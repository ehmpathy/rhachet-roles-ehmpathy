### 🧠 topic: trophic dynamics

---

### 🎯 goal
understand how energy moves through ecosystems by examining who eats whom, how much energy transfers, and what happens when the balance shifts.

---

### 🧭 trophic levels

- **autotrophs (producers)** – organisms that create energy-rich compounds from sunlight or chemicals (e.g., plants, algae)
- **herbivores (primary consumers)** – eat autotrophs (e.g., deer, insects)
- **carnivores (secondary+ consumers)** – eat other consumers (e.g., wolves, hawks)
- **decomposers** – break down dead organisms and recycle nutrients (e.g., fungi, bacteria)

🔄 energy flows **up**, nutrients **cycle**

---

### ⚡ energy transfer efficiency

- only ~**10%** of energy is passed to the next trophic level
- ~**90%** is lost as heat, movement, metabolism, or undigested material
- explains why:
  - food chains rarely extend beyond 4–5 levels
  - top predators are few in number and require large territories

---

### 🔗 food chains vs. food webs

#### **food chain**
- a **linear** sequence of who eats whom
  example: grass → grasshopper → frog → snake → hawk

#### **food web**
- a **network** of interconnected food chains
- reflects real-world complexity
- shows redundancy, indirect effects, and resilience potential

---

### 🔄 top-down vs. bottom-up control

#### **top-down (predator-driven)**
- predators suppress herbivores, allowing plant populations to grow
  example: adding wolves to Yellowstone → fewer deer → more willow trees

#### **bottom-up (resource-driven)**
- changes in resource availability (e.g., nutrients, water) affect producers, which cascade upward
  example: nutrient-poor soil → fewer plants → fewer herbivores → fewer predators

---

### 🔁 mental model
> trophic dynamics describe the **flow of energy and influence** in an ecosystem — like a supply chain where **efficiency is low** and **imbalances ripple** in either direction.
