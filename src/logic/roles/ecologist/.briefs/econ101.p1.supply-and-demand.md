### 🧠 topic: supply and demand
**how prices and quantities adjust in a market**

---

### 🎯 goal
understand how **markets coordinate trade** by adjusting prices and quantities through the interaction of buyers and sellers.

---

### 📉 demand
**how much consumers want to buy at each price**

- governed by the **law of demand**:
  → as price **falls**, quantity demanded **rises**
- why?
  - substitution effect: cheaper goods are more attractive
  - income effect: lower prices stretch purchasing power
- visual: **downward-sloping curve**

---

### 📈 supply
**how much producers are willing to sell at each price**

- governed by the **law of supply**:
  → as price **rises**, quantity supplied **rises**
- why?
  - higher prices cover costs and increase profit incentive
- visual: **upward-sloping curve**

---

### ⚖️ market equilibrium
**where supply meets demand**

- occurs at the price where quantity demanded = quantity supplied
- determines the **market-clearing price** and traded quantity
- market naturally moves toward this point unless restricted

#### ⛓ if price is too high:
- surplus (excess supply) → downward pressure on price

#### ⛓ if price is too low:
- shortage (excess demand) → upward pressure on price

---

### 🌪 shifts vs. movement

#### **movement along curves**
- caused by a **change in price**

#### **shifts of curves**
- caused by external factors:

**demand shifters**:
- income, tastes, number of buyers, expectations, price of related goods

**supply shifters**:
- input costs, technology, number of sellers, expectations, regulations

---

### 🌍 real-world shocks

- **drought** → supply shift left (less produced) → higher price
- **innovation** → supply shift right (more efficient production) → lower price
- **policy** (e.g., tax, subsidy) → alters supply or demand depending on target

---

### 🔁 mental model
> prices are the **signals** and quantities are the **responses** — together they form a **self-adjusting system** that matches what people want with what producers provide.
