### 🧠 topic: rational choice theory
**how agents optimize given preferences and constraints**

---

### 🎯 goal
understand the basic model of human behavior in economics: how people and firms **make choices to maximize value**, given their goals and limitations.

---

### 🧠 what is rational choice theory?

- a foundational idea in economics:
  **people act with purpose** — choosing what best serves their goals within their limits
- not about being “smart” — it’s about being **intentional and consistent**

---

### ⚙️ assumptions of rational agents

- **consistent preferences**
  → if A is preferred to B, and B to C, then A is preferred to C

- **cost-benefit reasoning**
  → agents compare **what they gain** vs. **what they give up**

- **utility maximization**
  → individuals aim to get the **most satisfaction (utility)**
  → firms aim to get the **most profit**

---

### ⛓ constraints on choice

- **budget** – can’t spend more than you have (money, time, energy)
- **information** – sometimes complete, often limited or biased
- **rules** – prices, laws, social norms, contracts

💡 rational choices happen **within a framework of trade-offs and limits**

---

### 📈 why it matters

- rational choice is the **default model** in economics
  → used to predict: demand, savings, labor effort, voting, consumption

- **when behavior deviates** from this model (e.g., emotion, habit, bias),
  → we get insights from **behavioral economics**

### 🧍‍♀️ everyday examples

#### 💵 grocery shopping on a budget
- pick the basket of goods that gives the most nutrition and enjoyment per dollar
- constraint = your wallet

#### 📅 scheduling your weekend
- pick activities that maximize fun, rest, or productivity
- constraint = 48 hours and competing priorities

#### 🧑‍💻 choosing between job offers
- compare benefits, pay, commute, culture
- choose what aligns best with goals, within real-world limits

### 🚫 common misunderstandings

- rational ≠ selfish
- rational ≠ correct
- rational ≠ emotionless
→ it just means: **based on consistent goals + trade-off logic**

---

### 🔁 mental model
> rational choice theory sees people as **goal-seeking decision-makers** — weighing costs, benefits, and constraints to make the **best available choice**, even if it’s not perfect.
