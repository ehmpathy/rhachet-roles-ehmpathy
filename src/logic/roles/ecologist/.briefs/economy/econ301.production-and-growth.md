### 💸 Tier 3: production and growth
**cluster**: inputs → outputs → scale

---

### 🎯 goal
understand how economies **turn inputs into outputs**, how firms and nations make efficient choices, and what drives **long-term growth in living standards**.

---

## 🏗 factors of production
**the basic ingredients of economic output**

- **land** – natural resources (soil, water, minerals, forests)
- **labor** – human effort and skills
- **capital** – tools, machines, infrastructure (not money itself)
- **entrepreneurship** – risk-taking, innovation, and coordination

💡 production requires **combining these inputs** efficiently to create goods and services

---

## 🧠 firm behavior & cost structures
**how businesses minimize cost and maximize profit**

- firms choose **how much to produce**, **what inputs to use**, and **how to organize production**
- guided by:
  - **marginal cost**: cost of producing one more unit
  - **marginal revenue**: revenue from selling one more unit
  - **profit max rule**: produce until MR = MC

- **cost structures** matter:
  - **fixed costs** (don’t change with output)
  - **variable costs** (scale with output)
  - **economies of scale**: average cost falls as output rises (up to a point)

---

## 🌍 comparative advantage & trade
**who should produce what, and why trade benefits all**

- **absolute advantage**: can produce more with same inputs
- **comparative advantage**: lower **opportunity cost** of producing something

💡 even if one party is “better” at everything, both sides **gain from trade** by specializing in what they’re relatively best at

#### example:
- country A makes wheat efficiently
- country B makes steel efficiently
→ trade wheat for steel = both get more than going solo

---

## 📈 economic growth & productivity
**what drives long-term output per person**

- **growth** = increase in real GDP per capita
- driven by:
  - **investment in capital** (machines, infrastructure)
  - **human capital** (education, health)
  - **innovation & tech** (doing more with less)
  - **institutions** (laws, markets, property rights)

💡 growth compounds over time — small gains now = huge gains later

---

### 🔁 mental model
> economies grow when they **use inputs wisely**, **specialize where efficient**, and **innovate over time** — turning today’s effort into tomorrow’s abundance.
