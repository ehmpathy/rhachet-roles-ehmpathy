### ➕ topic: marginal analysis
**decisions happen at the margin**

---

### 🎯 goal
shift from all-or-nothing thinking to **incremental decision-making** — evaluating whether doing a little more (or less) creates more value than it costs.

---

### 📐 key concept: the margin

- **"the margin"** = the next unit
  → next hour, next dollar, next slice, next mile

- most real-world decisions aren’t yes/no — they’re **“how much?”**
  → work 1 more hour? eat 1 more bite? add 1 more staff member?

---

### 🔍 marginal comparison

#### **marginal benefit (MB)**
- the **extra gain** from doing one more
  e.g., extra sales from 1 more ad, extra joy from 1 more cookie

#### **marginal cost (MC)**
- the **extra cost** of doing one more
  e.g., time, money, fatigue, risk

---

### ✅ decision rule
- **if MB > MC** → keep going
- **if MB < MC** → stop
- **if MB = MC** → optimal stopping point

💡 don’t judge based on total cost vs. total benefit — judge by **what the next step adds or subtracts**

---

### 📊 everyday examples

#### 🍕 eating another slice
- MB = more taste & fullness
- MC = discomfort, calories
→ **stop when enjoyment no longer outweighs regret**

#### 👩‍💼 hiring more help
- MB = extra output or sales
- MC = wages, overhead
→ **hire until the last person pays for themselves**

#### 🧠 studying for a test
- MB = better score, confidence
- MC = fatigue, missed sleep
→ **study until new info doesn’t stick or help**

#### 📺 watching another episode
- MB = relaxation, suspense payoff
- MC = lost sleep, time, next-day grogginess
→ **quit when the thrill isn't worth tomorrow's drag**

---

### 🚫 common traps

- looking only at **totals** instead of **next-step gains/losses**
- assuming “more = better” even when **returns diminish**
- failing to stop when benefits flatten out

---

### 🔁 mental model
> marginal analysis means always asking:
> **“is this next step worth it?”**
> when you think on the margin, you avoid waste, burnout, and regret — and make sharper, more efficient decisions.
