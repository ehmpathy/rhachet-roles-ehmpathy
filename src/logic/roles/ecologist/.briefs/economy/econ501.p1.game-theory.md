### 🎲 topic: game theory & strategic interaction
**how agents act when outcomes depend on others**

---

### 🎯 goal
develop intuition for **strategic decision-making** — where success depends not just on what you choose, but on what **others choose too**.

---

### 🔁 what makes a game?

- multiple **players**
- each has **choices (strategies)**
- each outcome gives a **payoff** to every player
- players are **interdependent** — your result depends on their actions

💡 game theory helps explain **competition, cooperation, and conflict** — in markets, politics, and daily life

---

### 📊 key concepts

#### **payoff matrix**
- a table showing all outcomes based on players’ choices
- each cell = combination of actions + resulting payoffs

#### **dominant strategy**
- a move that gives better results **no matter what others do**
- not all games have one — but when it exists, it simplifies decisions

#### **Nash equilibrium**
- a stable outcome where **no player has an incentive to change**
- everyone is doing the best they can **given what others are doing**

---

### 🎮 famous games

#### **prisoner’s dilemma**
- two individuals can cooperate or betray
- mutual cooperation = better for both
- but self-interest leads each to defect
→ result: both worse off than if they had trusted

💡 reveals tension between **individual incentives and collective good**

---

#### **coordination games**
- success depends on **matching** the other player
  - e.g., choosing same technology, meeting place, driving side

- often multiple Nash equilibria — problem is **getting aligned**

💡 shows that **expectations** and **culture** matter

---

### 🧠 real-world use cases

- **pricing wars** – undercutting vs. holding firm
- **negotiation** – when to concede or hold
- **market entry** – launch now or wait for a competitor
- **voting systems** – strategic voting, coalition formation
- **arms races** – invest or disarm?

---

### 🔁 mental model
> in strategic settings, outcomes depend on **what everyone does** — not just you.
> game theory helps map out those choices, clarify incentives, and reveal when **cooperation beats competition** — or when it doesn’t.

## 🎯 strategic use cases of game theory
**non-obvious but powerful real-world applications**


### 💵 1. **pricing in competitive markets**
- two firms competing: lower prices to gain share, but risk a price war
→ understanding the **prisoner’s dilemma** helps explain why firms may **agree tacitly** to hold prices steady

💡 usecase: airline pricing, gas stations, e-commerce discounting


### 🗳 2. **political positioning and platform design**
- candidates don’t just state beliefs — they **position relative to rivals**
→ game theory explains **why moderates converge** toward center in two-party races (median voter theorem)

💡 use in political strategy, debate prep, polling analysis


### 📦 3. **product launch timing**
- should you enter the market first and risk failure, or wait and risk being late?
→ game theory helps model **first-mover advantage vs. fast-follower strategy**

💡 usecase: tech products, pharma trials, media releases


### ⚖️ 4. **cartel stability and cheating**
- firms collude to raise prices — but each has an incentive to secretly undercut
→ payoff matrix predicts that **collusion is fragile without enforcement**

💡 use in antitrust, industry analysis, global oil markets (e.g., OPEC)


### 🧪 5. **clinical trial design**
- multiple companies racing to develop the same drug
→ do you go fast and cut corners or wait for better data?
→ decisions depend on **others’ actions and expected payoffs**

💡 use in biopharma R&D strategy


### 🤝 6. **negotiation & brinkmanship**
- each side wants more but risks collapse if they push too far
→ understanding **credible threats**, **bluffs**, and **mutual interest zones** is key

💡 usecase: labor talks, trade deals, hostage negotiations


### 🚧 7. **public goods & coordination failure**
- everyone benefits from a clean park or safe internet
→ but if **each waits for others to act**, nothing happens
→ coordination games explain **why policy or first movers matter**

💡 use in climate action, cybersecurity, city planning


### 🧠 8. **crowd behavior and tipping points**
- when will people panic, protest, or adopt a trend?
→ threshold models (a type of game) show how one person’s choice can trigger **cascades**

💡 use in marketing virality, movement building, crisis response


### 🔁 mental model
> game theory reveals the **hidden strategy layers** behind everyday decisions — where what you do depends not just on **what you want**, but on **what others do, expect, and believe**.
