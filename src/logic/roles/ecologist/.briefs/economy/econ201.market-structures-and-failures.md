### 🏛️ Tier 2: market structures and failures
**cluster**: how systems work (or break)

---

### 🎯 goal
understand how real-world markets **stabilize, shift, or fail**, and when **government intervention** may improve outcomes.

## ⚖️ market equilibrium & dynamics
**how prices and quantities stabilize or shift over time**

- equilibrium is **not static** — it responds to changing conditions
- **dynamic equilibrium**: markets adjust continually to new info, shocks, and feedback
- shifts can come from:
  - demand changes (e.g., new trends, income swings)
  - supply shocks (e.g., war, resource depletion)
- **over time**, price and quantity move to reflect new realities
- some markets adjust quickly (e.g., stocks), others slowly (e.g., housing)

## 📈 elasticity
**how responsive buyers and sellers are to changes in price**

- **price elasticity of demand (Ed)**:
  % change in quantity demanded ÷ % change in price
  - elastic (>1): buyers react strongly (e.g., luxury goods)
  - inelastic (<1): buyers react weakly (e.g., insulin)

- **price elasticity of supply (Es)**:
  how much sellers change output in response to price

- also relevant:
  - income elasticity (how demand changes with income)
  - cross-price elasticity (how demand changes when related goods’ prices change)

💡 elasticity affects:
- **who bears the burden** of taxes
- **revenue effects** of price changes
- **speed and scale** of market adjustment

## 🌫 externalities
**costs or benefits imposed on third parties**

- **negative externalities**:
  - impose costs without compensation (e.g., pollution, traffic, noise)
  - result in **overproduction** relative to the social optimum

- **positive externalities**:
  - create unearned benefits (e.g., vaccines, education, pollinator habitats)
  - result in **underproduction** unless subsidized

📊 without intervention, markets **ignore external effects**, leading to inefficient outcomes

---

## 🏛 market failure & government intervention
**when and how policy steps in**

- **market failure**: when self-regulating markets don’t allocate resources efficiently
  - causes: externalities, public goods, asymmetric info, monopolies

- **types of interventions**:
  - **taxes** on negative externalities (e.g., carbon tax)
  - **subsidies** for positive externalities (e.g., education grants)
  - **regulation** (e.g., emissions caps, product standards)
  - **public provision** (e.g., roads, fire protection)
  - **antitrust enforcement** to prevent monopolies

⚠️ interventions can help or hurt — success depends on **incentive design**, **information**, and **enforcement**

### 🔁 mental model
> markets are powerful but **imperfect tools** — they often reach stable outcomes, but those outcomes may not be **fair, efficient, or sustainable** without thoughtful correction.
