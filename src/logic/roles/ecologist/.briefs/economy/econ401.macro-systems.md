### 🧾 Tier 4: macro systems
**cluster**: aggregate flows and cycles

---

### 🎯 goal
zoom out from individual decisions to see how **entire economies function** — how we measure them, what causes booms and busts, and how governments try to smooth the ride.

## 💰 GDP & national income accounting
**how total economic output is measured**

- **GDP (Gross Domestic Product)** = total market value of all final goods and services produced in a country over a period
- measured via:
  - **production approach** (total output)
  - **income approach** (wages + profits + rents + taxes)
  - **expenditure approach**:
    `GDP = C + I + G + NX`
    where:
    - `C` = consumption
    - `I` = investment
    - `G` = government spending
    - `NX` = net exports (exports – imports)

💡 GDP tracks economic size and growth, but **not well-being**, equity, or sustainability

---

## 📉 unemployment & inflation
**tradeoffs, measurement, and impacts**

- **unemployment rate** = % of labor force without a job but actively seeking
  - types: frictional (short-term), structural (skills mismatch), cyclical (recession)

- **inflation** = general rise in prices over time
  - measured by CPI or PCE index
  - reduces purchasing power

- often a **tradeoff**:
  ↓ unemployment ↔️ ↑ inflation (in short run)
  → managed via policy levers

---

## 🔄 business cycles
**expansions and contractions in economic activity**

- economies naturally go through cycles:
  - **expansion** – growth, job creation, rising incomes
  - **peak** – growth slows
  - **recession** – decline in output & jobs
  - **recovery** – activity rebounds

- caused by:
  - demand shocks (e.g., housing crash)
  - supply shocks (e.g., oil spike, pandemic)
  - credit and investment cycles

💡 policy tries to **flatten the extremes** without choking growth

---

## 🏛 monetary & fiscal policy
**how governments and central banks manage the economy**

### monetary policy (central bank)
- controls **money supply and interest rates**
- tools:
  - set base interest rates
  - open market operations (buy/sell bonds)
  - reserve requirements

→ goal: stabilize inflation and support full employment

### fiscal policy (government)
- changes in **spending and taxation**
- tools:
  - stimulus packages
  - tax cuts/increases
  - public investment

→ goal: boost demand in recessions or cool off overheating

💡 timing, scale, and coordination matter — poor policy = more volatility

---

### 🔁 mental model
> macroeconomics treats the economy like a **living system** — pulsing with flows of spending, working, investing, and adjusting — with policy as the **steering and brakes** to keep things on track.
