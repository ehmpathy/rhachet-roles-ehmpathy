### 💸 topic: opportunity cost & trade-offs
**what choosing one option costs in terms of the next-best**

---

### 🎯 goal
build intuition for how **every choice has a cost**, even when no money changes hands — and how good decision-making depends on recognizing what’s **given up**.

---

### 🌍 scarcity forces choices

- we live in a world of **limited time, money, energy, and resources**
- choosing one path means **not choosing others**
- this trade-off is the foundation of economics

---

### 🧠 opportunity cost defined

- **opportunity cost** = the value of the **next-best alternative foregone**
- not just money — includes time, effort, enjoyment, and risk

#### examples:
- going to college → lose 4 years of income
- taking a job → give up leisure or other offers
- buying a truck → give up the chance to invest that money

💡 the true cost of any action is **everything you gave up to do it**

---

### ⚖️ trade-off thinking

- helps compare options **on equal footing**
- sharpens decisions by shifting the frame from:
  → “can I afford this?” to
  → “is this **worth more** than what I’d give up?”

---

### 🚫 common traps

- ignoring **non-obvious costs** (e.g., time, flexibility)
- falling for **sunk cost fallacy**: continuing just because you’ve already invested
- thinking in **absolutes**, not **alternatives**

---

### 🔁 mental model
> every “yes” is a “no” to something else — smart choices require **clear comparisons**, not just **gut reactions** or dollar signs.


---

### 🧠 strategic use cases of opportunity cost
**real-life examples for everyday decision-making**

#### 🕒 1. saying yes to overtime
- working extra hours brings more money
- **but costs**: time with family, rest, hobbies, long-term health

💡 ask: “am I trading money for something I’ll regret missing?”

#### 🍽 2. eating out vs. cooking at home
- dining out saves time and adds enjoyment
- **but costs**: money, nutrition, and maybe missed cooking skills

💡 usecase: weekly planning, budgeting, health decisions

#### 🚗 3. buying a new car
- new car = convenience + reliability
- **but costs**: thousands in financing that could go toward a vacation, savings, or debt payoff

💡 ask: “is this comfort worth the next-best use of that money?”

#### 🎓 4. going back to school
- education can boost long-term income
- **but costs**: time, tuition, lost work income, delayed experience

💡 usecase: career pivots, side hustle vs. grad school decisions

#### 📺 5. watching TV vs. doing something else
- shows offer relaxation and entertainment
- **but costs**: opportunity to read, exercise, sleep, or create

💡 ask: “am I recharging or just escaping?”

#### 🛍 6. impulse purchases
- buying a trendy gadget feels good now
- **but costs**: that money can’t go toward travel, gifts, or emergencies later

💡 usecase: practicing mindful spending

#### 🧠 7. staying in a job you don’t like
- stable income and routine
- **but costs**: growth, purpose, new experiences, higher-paying roles elsewhere

💡 ask: “what is this comfort costing me over the next 5 years?”

### 🔁 mental model
> opportunity cost shows up in **everyday trade-offs** — not just big purchases, but in **how you spend time, energy, and attention**.
> better choices come from asking:
> “what else could I be doing with this?”
