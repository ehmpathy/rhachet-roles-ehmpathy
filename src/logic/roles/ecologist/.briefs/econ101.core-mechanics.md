### 🧠 Tier 1: core mechanics
**cluster**: scarcity, trade, and behavior

---

### 🎯 goal
build foundational intuition for **how people, firms, and systems make choices** in a world of limited resources — and how those choices shape prices, trade, and outcomes.

---

## ⚖️ supply and demand
**how prices and quantities adjust in a market**

- **demand**: how much buyers want at each price
  – downward-sloping: lower price → more buyers
- **supply**: how much sellers provide at each price
  – upward-sloping: higher price → more incentive to produce
- **equilibrium**: where supply = demand
  – determines the **market price** and **quantity exchanged**
- shocks (e.g., drought, innovation, policy) shift curves and change outcomes

---

## 💸 opportunity cost & trade-offs
**what choosing one option costs in terms of the next-best**

- resources are limited, so every choice **comes at a cost**
- **opportunity cost** = value of the next-best alternative foregone
  e.g., the cost of going to college = tuition + lost income from working
- clear thinking requires comparing **what you get** vs. **what you give up**

---

## ➕ marginal analysis
**decisions happen at the margin**

- people respond to **incremental changes**, not total values
- compare:
  - **marginal benefit (MB)** = extra gain from one more unit
  - **marginal cost (MC)** = extra cost from one more unit
- rule: **do more** if MB > MC, **stop** when MB = MC
  e.g., hire an extra worker if they generate more revenue than they cost

## 🧠 rational choice theory
**how agents optimize given preferences and constraints**

- agents (people, firms) assumed to:
  - have **consistent preferences**
  - weigh **costs vs. benefits**
  - choose options that **maximize utility (happiness) or profit**
- subject to constraints:
  - **budget** (money, time)
  - **information** (perfect or limited)
  - **rules** (laws, norms, prices)

📈 used as a baseline model for predicting behavior — deviations from it reveal behavioral patterns, biases, or external forces

### 🔁 mental model
> economics begins with a simple truth: **we can’t have everything**, so we must **choose**. those choices ripple outward — shaping **markets, trade, and behavior** through prices, costs, and marginal gains.
