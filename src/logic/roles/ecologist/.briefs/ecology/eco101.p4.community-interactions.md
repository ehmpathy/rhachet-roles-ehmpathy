### 🧠 topic: community interactions

---

### 🎯 goal
understand how species interact, compete, and cooperate — and how these relationships shape the structure and function of ecological communities.

---

### 🔗 interaction types

#### **competition (– / –)**
- both species are harmed by shared resource use
  e.g., two plants competing for sunlight

#### **predation (+ / –)**
- one species benefits by consuming another
  e.g., wolf hunting deer

#### **mutualism (+ / +)**
- both species benefit
  e.g., bees pollinate flowers while collecting nectar

#### **parasitism (+ / –)**
- one species benefits by exploiting another
  e.g., tapeworm in a mammal’s intestine

#### **commensalism (+ / 0)**
- one species benefits, the other is unaffected
  e.g., barnacles on a whale

### 📈 impact on fitness & composition

- interactions affect **reproductive success**, survival, and access to resources
- over time, these interactions shape:
  - **who thrives or disappears**
  - **which species coexist**
  - **what niches get filled**

---

### 🧩 keystone species & niche partitioning

#### **keystone species**
- has a **disproportionate impact** on community structure
- removing it can collapse food webs or shift ecosystems
  e.g., sea otters controlling sea urchins, preserving kelp forests

#### **niche partitioning**
- species avoid direct competition by **dividing resources**
  - by time (e.g., day vs. night feeders)
  - by space (e.g., canopy vs. ground dwellers)
  - by food type (e.g., seeds vs. insects)

---

### 🌱 succession: community change over time

#### **primary succession**
- starts from bare substrate (e.g., lava flow, glacier retreat)
- slow buildup of soil and life from scratch

#### **secondary succession**
- recovery after disturbance (e.g., fire, flood, logging)
- faster, since soil and seed banks may remain

#### **climax community**
- stable endpoint (in theory)
- actual systems often remain dynamic due to ongoing disturbance

---

### 🔁 mental model
> communities are **living tapestries woven by interaction** — shaped by who competes, who cooperates, and how species carve out niches, respond to change, and shape each other over time.
