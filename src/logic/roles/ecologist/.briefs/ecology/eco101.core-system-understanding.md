### 🧠 Tier 1: core system understanding
**cluster**: ecological fundamentals

---

### 🎯 goal
equip new ecologists with the mental models to understand **how life systems function** — from parts to patterns, individuals to ecosystems.

---

## 🌐 ecosystem structure
**understand components, flows, and scales**

- **biotic components**: producers, consumers, decomposers
- **abiotic components**: sunlight, soil, water, temperature, nutrients
- **flows**: energy moves one-way (sun → heat); materials cycle (carbon, nitrogen, water)
- **scales**: patch → landscape → biome; daily → seasonal → successional
- **boundaries**: often conceptual (e.g., watershed, study plot)

💡 ecosystems are structured by **what's in them**, how things **move**, and **where and when** they operate

---

## 🔗 trophic dynamics
**who eats whom, and how energy moves**

- **trophic levels**: autotroph → herbivore → carnivore → decomposer
- **energy transfer**: ~10% efficiency per level → top predators are rare
- **food chains** show direct links; **food webs** reveal complex interactions
- **top-down** control: predators shape lower levels
- **bottom-up** control: resource availability shapes entire system

💡 trophic structure determines **who survives**, **who influences whom**, and **how resilient the system is**

---

## 📈 population ecology
**how populations grow, shrink, or stabilize**

- growth models: **exponential** (J-curve) vs. **logistic** (S-curve)
- **carrying capacity (K)** = max sustainable population
- **density dependence**: as density increases, resources become limiting
- dynamics driven by: births, deaths, immigration, emigration
- tools: **life tables**, **survivorship curves**, **growth rates**

💡 population trends reveal how species **respond to limits**, **recover**, or **collapse**

---

## 🧬 community interactions
**species affect each other’s fitness through interactions**

- interaction types:
  - **competition (–/–)**
  - **predation (+/–)**
  - **mutualism (+/+)**
  - **parasitism (+/–)**
  - **commensalism (+/0)**
- **keystone species**: have disproportionate effects on structure
- **niche partitioning**: species avoid direct conflict by specializing
- **succession**: communities evolve over time, from colonization to climax

💡 communities are shaped by a **web of effects**, where gains and losses ripple across species and time

---

### 🔁 mental model
> life systems are **interdependent networks of flow, feedback, and interaction** — understanding them requires seeing not just parts, but **how parts connect, scale, and change**.
