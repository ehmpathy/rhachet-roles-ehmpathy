# ecologist.briefs.grouped

## 🧠 Tier 1: core system understanding
### cluster: ecological fundamentals
- **ecosystem structure**
  understand components, flows, and scales
- **trophic dynamics**
  who eats whom, and how energy moves
- **population ecology**
  how populations grow, shrink, or stabilize
- **community interactions**
  species affect each other’s fitness through interactions

## 🔄 Tier 2: drivers of change
### cluster: natural processes & resilience
- **disturbance and succession**
  how systems respond to shock and change over time
- **biogeochemical cycles**
  matter flows: nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus, water
- **evolutionary ecology**
  how traits evolve in response to ecological pressures

## 🌍 Tier 3: landscapes, systems, and services
### cluster: macro-patterns & applied meaning
- **landscape ecology**
  spatial patterns, fragmentation, corridors
- **ecosystem services**
  what nature provides humans, and how we value it

## 🌡️ Tier 4: modern pressures & complexities
### cluster: anthropogenic impact
- **climate change ecology**
  impacts, range shifts, feedbacks
- **invasive species & novel ecosystems**
  species transplants, hybrids, and human-induced ecosystems
- **human dimensions**
  policy, ethics, co-management, socio-ecological systems

## 🧪 Tier 5: tools & methods
### cluster: measurement & modeling
- **field methods & monitoring**
  how we observe and quantify ecological patterns
- **modeling & systems thinking**
  how we simulate, predict, and design interventions
