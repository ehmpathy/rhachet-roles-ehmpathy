### 🧠 topic: population ecology

---

### 🎯 goal
learn how populations grow, shrink, and stabilize — and what forces shape their numbers over time.

---

### 📈 population growth models

#### **exponential growth**
- occurs when resources are unlimited
- population grows at a constant rate
- **J-shaped curve**
- equation: `dN/dt = rN`
  where `r` = intrinsic rate of increase, `N` = population size

#### **logistic growth**
- growth slows as resources become limited
- approaches a maximum size: **carrying capacity (K)**
- **S-shaped curve**
- equation: `dN/dt = rN(1 - N/K)`

### 🏞 carrying capacity & density dependence

#### **carrying capacity (K)**
- the max population size an environment can sustain over time
- shaped by resource availability, habitat space, and ecosystem limits

#### **density-dependent factors**
- effects that increase with population size
  e.g., disease, competition, predation, stress

#### **density-independent factors**
- effects unrelated to population size
  e.g., weather events, natural disasters, pollution

### 🧮 population change drivers

- **births (B)** – increase population
- **deaths (D)** – decrease population
- **immigration (I)** – individuals entering the population
- **emigration (E)** – individuals leaving the population

📊 total change: `ΔN = (B + I) - (D + E)`

### 📊 life tables & survivorship curves

#### **life tables**
- track survival and reproduction across age classes
- used to calculate life expectancy, mortality rates, and reproduction output

#### **survivorship curves**
- graph survival probability over lifespan
  - **Type I**: low early mortality (e.g., humans)
  - **Type II**: constant mortality (e.g., birds)
  - **Type III**: high early mortality (e.g., fish, plants)

### 🔁 mental model
> population ecology reveals how a species’ **numbers respond to internal feedbacks and external forces** — shaped by **births, deaths, limits, and movement** over time.
