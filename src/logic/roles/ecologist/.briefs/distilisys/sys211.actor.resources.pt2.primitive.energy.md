## ⚡ ecologist.brief: energy

> energy is the fuel of action — finite, spendable, and required for every move.
> actors must manage it carefully: too little, and no chance can be taken.

### 🧱 what it is
a **spendable capacity** for doing work
every action costs energy; nothing happens without it

---

### 🧲 why it matters

- **energy gates action**
  <<gain>>[energy] → <<gain>>[chance] — no energy, no opportunity to act

- **depletion risks collapse**
  <<drop>>[energy] → <<drop>>[chance] — actors become unable to move, flee, feed, or choose

- **efficiency extends agency**
  <<save>>[energy] → <<gain>>[chance] — preserved energy allows future actions

---

### 🧭 how [energy] drives actors

> energy is always draining — every step, signal, or struggle consumes it.
> actors are driven to **spend it well**, **save it when possible**, and **replenish it regularly**.

#### valid drivers

- **<<save>>[energy]** ✅
  increases longevity, optionality, and future flexibility
  produced by:
  - <<drop>>[waste] — stop actions with poor return
  - <<lift>>[efficiency] — reduce energy required per action
  - <<drop>>[friction] — minimize resistance, drag, or opposition

- **<<gain>>[energy]** ✅
  actors must actively recover energy through rest or intake
  - <consume>[food]
  - <store>[fat]
  - <rest> to regenerate

#### inapplicable

- **<<lift>>[energy]** ❌
  energy has no qualitative height — only quantity and availability

- **<<drop>>[energy]** ❌
  dropping energy unintentionally is just waste — not a deliberate motive

### 🧪 examples

- **hunt** prey at dusk despite fatigue
  → <spend>[energy] → <<gain>>[chance] to feed before dark

- **choose** shaded paths while migrating
  → <<drop>>[friction] → <<save>>[energy] → <<gain>>[chance] to reach destination

- **skip** unnecessary fights with rivals
  → <<drop>>[waste] → <<save>>[energy] → <<gain>>[chance] to survive leaner periods

- **eat** high-fat foods before winter
  → <consume>[food] → <<gain>>[energy] → <<gain>>[chance] to endure scarcity
