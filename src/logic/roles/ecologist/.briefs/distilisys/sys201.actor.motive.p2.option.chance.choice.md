## 🧭 ecologist.brief: option vs chance vs choice

> these three terms describe how actors relate to possible paths.
> each plays a distinct role in motive grammar:
> - **option** defines availability
> - **chance** adds motive
> - **choice** commits to action

---

### 🛣️ option
a path the actor *could* take
neutral — no preference, pressure, or motive required

---

### 🎯 chance
a path the actor is *driven* to take
an option made salient by motive — not yet taken, but charged with relevance

→ `chance = option × motive`

*note: [chance] is a synonym for [opportunity]*

---

### 🗳️ choice
a path the actor *commits* to take
it turns potential into action

→ `choice = chance × decision`

#### ⌛ reversibility and entropy

- **reversible choices** preserve optionality
  → paths remain open; entropy stays low
  _ex: briefly probing a foraging site_

- **irreversible choices** consume or foreclose options
  → future paths collapse; entropy rises
  _ex: attacking a predator, migrating, mating_

> reversibility measures how much **future agency** is preserved
> irreversible choices accelerate **entropic decay**
> reversibility is how actors **buffer against commitment risk**

### 🧪 summary

| term   | definition                      | identity          |
|--------|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| option | a possible path                 | —                 |
| chance | a motivated option              | option × motive   |
| choice | a committed path                | chance × decision |

## 🧪 examples: option vs chance vs choice

---

### 1. 🐦 bird sees two berry bushes

- **option**:
  - [option.1] = bush.1 with 5 berries
  - [option.2] = bush.2 with 3–10 berries (uncertain yield)

- **chance**:
  - [chance.1] = <<gain>>[berries] ×5 → <<gain>>[energy], <<gain>>[nutrients]
  - [chance.2] = <<gain>>[berries] ×3–10 → same drivers, higher upside

- **choice**:
  commits to [chance.2] — starts with bush.2
  - reasoning: higher yield may meet need in one stop
  - fallback remains if yield is low

- ⌛ **reversibility**:
  - initially reversible (can switch bushes)
  - becomes irreversible once berries are consumed → entropy ↑

---

### 2. 🧑 human choosing a job offer

- **option**:
  - [option.1] = local company (stable, low growth)
  - [option.2] = startup (high risk, high upside)

- **chance**:
  - [chance.1] = <<gain>>[income], <<drop>>[risk]
  - [chance.2] = <<gain>>[equity], <<lift>>[future potential], <<gain>>[experience]

- **choice**:
  commits to [chance.2] — accepts startup offer
  - reasoning: aligns with ambition and growth motive

- ⌛ **reversibility**:
  - partially reversible (can leave job), but
  - opportunity cost and sunk effort accumulate → entropy ↑

### 3. 🐘 elephant approaches waterholes

- **option**:
  - [option.1] = nearby, crowded waterhole
  - [option.2] = distant, quieter waterhole

- **chance**:
  - [chance.1] = <<gain>>[water] quickly, but risk <<drop>>[access]
  - [chance.2] = <<gain>>[water], <<lift>>[safety], <<drop>>[conflict], at cost of <<drop>>[time]

- **choice**:
  commits to [chance.2] — takes the distant route
  - reasoning: safer, more reliable, fewer competitors

- ⌛ **reversibility**:
  - mostly irreversible — once underway, less useful to retreat
  - travel cost and risk compound → entropy ↑
