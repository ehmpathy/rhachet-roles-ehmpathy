# 🧭 ecologist.actor.motive primitives

these primitives define how actors relate to paths, pressure, and loss over time.

## ⌛ 1. reversibility & entropy

- **reversibility** = how much future [option]ality is preserved after a [choice]
- **entropy** = the collapse of future [option]s following irreversible [choice]
  → entropy rises as [choice]s foreclose paths
  → reversibility slows entropic loss

---

## 🎲 2. option, chance, choice

- **option** = could
- **chance** = should
- **choice** = will

\`\`\`text
chance = option × motive
choice = chance × decision
\`\`\`

- **option** defines what’s available
- **chance** defines what’s relevant
- **choice** defines what’s committed

---

## ⚠️ 3. chance.motive.polarity, threat

- [chance] can carry **positive** or **negative** motive polarity
  → pulls the actor toward, or pushes them away

- a **[threat]** is a [chance] with **decentive motive**
  → [chance].motive = {-decentive}

- threats still follow the [chance] structure
  → they are possible futures, just ones the actor is **driven to avoid**

\`\`\`text
threat = [chance].motive={decentive}
       = option × motive={decentive}
\`\`\`

## 🧭 4. motive horizon: why actors act

- all actions aim to:
  - **<<gain>>[chance]** → expand attractive futures
  - **<<drop>>[threat]** → eliminate repulsive ones

- [time], [energy], [status], etc. are not motives themselves — they are **levers** to shift [chance] or [threat]

\`\`\`text
mechanism → <<effect>>[resource] → <<gain>>[chance]
mechanism → <<effect>>[resource] → <<drop>>[threat]
\`\`\`

📌 intelligence = managing levers to maximize [chance], minimize [threat]

## 🧠 5. motive grammar: distilisys + actor motive

- extends `distilisys:grammar` by adding **motive force** to system flows

- every action flows from:
  - `<mechanism>` → <<effect>>[resource] → <<gain>>[chance]
  - `<mechanism>` → <<effect>>[resource] → <<drop>>[threat]

- `{driver}` adds pressure context:
  - `{+incentive}`, `{-decentive}` → actor-driven
  - `{+tailwind}`, `{-headwind}` → environment-driven

- `[resource]` only matters when it shifts exposure to [chance] or [threat]

📌 motive grammar = distilisys + reason to act
