# üß≠ ecologist.actor.motive primitives

these primitives define how actors relate to paths, pressure, and loss over time.

## ‚åõ 1. reversibility & entropy

- **reversibility** = how much future [option]ality is preserved after a [choice]
- **entropy** = the collapse of future [option]s following irreversible [choice]
  ‚Üí entropy rises as [choice]s foreclose paths
  ‚Üí reversibility slows entropic loss

---

## üé≤ 2. option, chance, choice

- **option** = could
- **chance** = should
- **choice** = will

\`\`\`text
chance = option √ó motive
choice = chance √ó decision
\`\`\`

- **option** defines what‚Äôs available
- **chance** defines what‚Äôs relevant
- **choice** defines what‚Äôs committed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. chance.motive.polarity, threat

- [chance] can carry **positive** or **negative** motive polarity
  ‚Üí pulls the actor toward, or pushes them away

- a **[threat]** is a [chance] with **decentive motive**
  ‚Üí [chance].motive = {-decentive}

- threats still follow the [chance] structure
  ‚Üí they are possible futures, just ones the actor is **driven to avoid**

\`\`\`text
threat = [chance].motive={decentive}
       = option √ó motive={decentive}
