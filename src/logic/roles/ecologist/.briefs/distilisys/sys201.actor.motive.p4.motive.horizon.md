## 🧭 ecologist.brief: motive horizon - why [chance] and [threat] govern behavior

why [chance] and [threat] govern behavior

> at the root of all behavior is the drive to manage possible futures.
> every action serves one of two ends:
> - **<<gain>>[chance]** — expand potential
> - **<<drop>>[threat]** — reduce danger

### 🧲 motive gravity

all other resource motives (e.g. time, energy, safety) ultimately trace back to their impact on:

- how many **[chance]s** an actor can unlock
- how many **[threat]s** an actor must avoid

these two shape the actor’s **motive horizon** — the effective space of action and survival.

### 🧪 motive forms

\`\`\`text
[chance] = [option] × motive
[threat] = [chance].motive = {-decentive}
\`\`\`

therefore:

- **<<gain>>[chance]** = increase attractive futures
- **<<drop>>[threat]** = eliminate repulsive futures

### 📚 references

this framework aligns with several observations in ai and decision theory research:

- **universal intelligence** (leg & hutter, 2007)
  → intelligence = ability to achieve goals across environments
  → aligns with maximizing available [chance]

- **empowerment theory** (klyubin et al., 2005)
  → agents act to maximize future optionality
  → maps to <<save>>[chance] and reduce entropic collapse

- **free energy principle** (friston, 2010)
  → agents minimize surprise (i.e., unpredicted [threat]s)

- **economic utility theory**
  → value comes from expanding possible actions and reducing negative consequences

### 🧪 distilled law

> **intelligence seeks to maximize [chance] and minimize [threat]**
> all other motives are support systems for this horizon

### 🧱 resources vs motive

resources like [time], [energy], [space], [status], etc.
are **not motives themselves** — they are tools actors manage to shift their exposure to [chance] or [threat].

> 📌 every action affecting a resource only matters **insofar as** it:
> - enables **<<gain>>[chance]**, or
> - enables **<<drop>>[threat]**

---

### 🧪 examples

- <<save>>[time] → <<gain>>[chance] to act again
- <<gain>>[energy] → unlocks future options
- <<drop>>[delay] → avoids missed opportunities
- <<lift>>[visibility] → avoids surprise attack → <<drop>>[threat]
- <<gain>>[status] → attracts mates → <<gain>>[chance] for reproduction

### 🔁 resource → motive chain

\`\`\`text
<mechanism> → <<effect>>[resource] → <<gain>>[chance]
<mechanism> → <<effect>>[resource] → <<drop>>[threat]
\`\`\`

intermediate effects serve as **levers** toward the actor's ultimate drive:
maximize opportunity, minimize harm.

📌 motive grammar simplifies:
- **what actors care about** → [chance], [threat]
- **why resources matter** → as levers
- **how behavior is structured** → as resource-driven motive traces
