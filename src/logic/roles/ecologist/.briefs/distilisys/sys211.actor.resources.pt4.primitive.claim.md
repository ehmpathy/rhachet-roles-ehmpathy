## 🧠 ecologist.brief: claim

> [claim] is a **mental resource** — a unit of belief, knowledge, or inference.
> actors manage claims to reduce uncertainty, plan effectively, and coordinate meaning.

### 🧱 what it is
[claim] is a **representational state** about the world or self.
it enables reasoning, prediction, and adaptation.

unlike physical resources, [claim] is **internal** — a cognitive asset that affects action.

---

### 🧲 why it matters

- <<gain>>[claim] → <<gain>>[chance] to act wisely
- <<drop>>[claim] → <<drop>>[threat] of being wrong
- <<save>>[claim] → preserve useful belief or memory
- <<lift>>[claim] → increase the utility or scope of a claim

---

### 🧬 types of [claim]

every [claim] belongs to a **cluster** — a structural subtype that shapes its role:

| cluster       | what it represents                     | example                              |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| [lesson]      | learned regularity from experience      | “fire burns”                         |
| [assumption]  | belief without verification             | “they probably left”                |
| [question]    | open gap in knowledge or certainty      | “why did it break?”                 |
| [pattern]     | reusable structure, case, or analogy    | “rain usually means earthworms”     |

> 📌 [pattern] replaces [observation]
> → emphasizes structured, reusable **case knowledge** over atomic facts

### 🧭 how [claim] drives actors

- actors constantly evaluate and adjust [claim]s to:
  - resolve ambiguity
  - improve predictions
  - guide coordination

#### valid drivers

- **<<gain>>[claim]** ✅
  - acquire new beliefs, facts, patterns
  - often via <observe>, <ask>, <simulate>

- **<<drop>>[claim]** ✅
  - discard false or outdated beliefs
  - often via <revise>, <debug>, <test>

- **<<save>>[claim]** ✅
  - memorize or preserve important beliefs
  - often via <note>, <store>, <encode>

- **<<lift>>[claim]** ✅
  - improve generality, abstraction, or power of inference
  - e.g. turning a [pattern] into a [lesson]

---

### 🧪 examples

- <ask> → <<gain>>[claim:pattern] → <<gain>>[chance] to choose a safe tool
- <debug> → <<drop>>[claim:assumption] → <<drop>>[threat] of mistake
- <note> → <<save>>[claim:lesson] → <<gain>>[chance] to reuse knowledge
- <reflect> → <<lift>>[claim:pattern] → <<gain>>[chance] to generalize behavior
- <simulate> → <<gain>>[claim:question] → <<gain>>[chance] to plan better

### 🧲 claim vs info

| term      | what it represents                  | actor dependency |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|------------------|
| [info]    | raw data, objective signal           | no               |
| [claim]   | belief or structure **held by actor** | yes              |

> 📌 [claim] = **info + ownership**
> → a system only has a [claim] if it holds, stores, or references it

---

### 🔁 cycles

- actors often loop:
  - <observe> → <<gain>>[claim:pattern]
  - <test> → <<drop>>[claim:assumption]
  - <reflect> → <<lift>>[claim:lesson]
- these loops govern intelligence, learning, and planning

---

### 🧪 motive traces

```text
<observe> → <<gain>>[claim:pattern] → <<gain>>[chance]
<debug> → <<drop>>[claim:assumption] → <<drop>>[threat]
<note> → <<save>>[claim:lesson] → <<gain>>[chance] to reuse
```
