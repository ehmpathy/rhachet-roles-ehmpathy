## 🧭 ecologist.brief: motive polarity

> all behavior is driven by motive — but not all motive attracts.
> motive can pull actors toward outcomes (**incentives**) or push them away (**decentives**).
> this polarity applies to [chance] — possible futures with motivational force.

### 🧲 incentive
a **positive motive** — pulls the actor toward a future
→ drives **approach behavior**

- examples:
  - food → <<gain>>[energy]
  - mate → <<gain>>[reproductive chance]
  - shelter → <<drop>>[exposure]

---

### 🧲 decentive _(preferred term)_
a **negative motive** — pushes the actor away from a future
→ drives **avoidance behavior**

> 📌 a decentive is still a motive — not its absence
> it creates urgency, direction, and action — just in reverse

- examples:
  - predator → <<drop>>[life], <<drop>>[agency]
  - fire → <<drop>>[resource]
  - toxin → <<drop>>[health]

---

### ⚖️ polarity applied to [chance]

> **[chance] = [option] × motive**
> polarity determines whether the actor is driven *toward* or *away*

---

#### ⚠️ [threat]
a **negatively motivated [chance]** — a possible future the actor is driven to avoid

→ `threat = chance.motive = {-decentive}`

- a threat is still a [chance] — it might happen
- what distinguishes it is that the actor wants to avoid it; a **push-away** motive polarity

this includes:
- **[risk]** — the [chance].probability of this [threat]
- **[pain]** — the [chance].outcome of this [threat]

> 📌 [risk] and [pain] are specific to [threat]s,
> but their structure — `chance.probability` and `chance.outcome` — applies to all [chance]s

### 🧪 summary

| concept      | what it is                         | motive polarity  | behavior it drives   |
|--------------|------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| [chance]     | possible outcome with motive       | + or –           | approach or avoid    |
| [threat]     | chance with decentive motive       | –                | avoidance            |
| [magnet]     | chance with incentive motive       | +                | approach             |
| incentive    | motive that attracts               | +                | approach             |
| decentive    | motive that repels                 | –                | avoidance            |

📌 prefer **decentive** over *disincentive*
→ it is morphologically parallel to *incentive*
→ and fits cleanly into the grammar of [chance].motive
