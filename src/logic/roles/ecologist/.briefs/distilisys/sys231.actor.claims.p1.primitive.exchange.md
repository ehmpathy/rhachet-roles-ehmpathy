# 📘 ecologist.brief: claim exchange mechanisms

> this brief defines the **fundamental ways [claim]s move between actors**.
> every social interaction involving mental models reduces to one of three atomic mechanisms:
> **<push>**, **<pull>**, or **<grab>**.

## 🧩 primitives

these are the **irreducible operations** by which actors exchange [claim]s — the building blocks of all communication, collaboration, or persuasion.

---

### ➡️ <push>[claim] = <speak> & <verify>
> the actor **offers** a [claim] to another, and checks that it landed
- initiator: speaker
- direction: outward
- outcome: **transfer**

🧬 **example:**
A shopkeeper calls out,
> “Fresh apples! Sweet and crisp!”

They watch to see who hears and reacts.
This is a **<push>** — they *offer a claim* and check if it sticks.

---

### ⬅️ <pull>[claim] = <probe> & <study> & <verify>
> the actor **extracts** a [claim] from another through questioning or prompting
- initiator: listener
- direction: inward
- outcome: **elicit**

🧬 **example:**
A passerby stops and asks,
> “What’s in season today?”

The shopkeeper replies with what’s best — *a new claim, drawn out by the question*.
This is a **<pull>** — *the listener triggers the reveal*.

---

### 🫳 <grab>[claim] = <study> & <verify>
> the actor **takes in** an already-offered [claim], and verifies its meaning
- initiator: listener
- direction: inward
- outcome: **absorb**

🧬 **example:**
A second passerby, just walking by, hears
> “Fresh apples!”

They glance, nod, and walk over to buy — without saying a word.
This is a **<grab>** — *they took the claim in and absorbed it*.

---

## 🧠 why <grab> is unique

> **<grab>** exists to give the **listener** agency over unrequested signals.
> no equivalent exists for the speaker, because **<push> already covers all speaker intent**.

- speakers control the channel — they choose when to push
- listeners don’t control the speaker — but they can choose what to **pull** or **grab**

## 🧬 summary

| mechanism | who initiates | direction | description                   |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| <push>    | speaker        | →         | offer + confirm delivery      |
| <pull>    | listener       | ←         | prompt + extract + confirm    |
| <grab>    | listener       | →         | accept offered claim + verify |

these three form the **core grammar of cognitive exchange**.
everything else — debate, teaching, bonding — is a **composite protocol** built from these.

## 🧠 more analogies

---

### 🎓 teacher–student

- **<push>** → the teacher explains a concept:
  > “photosynthesis is how plants convert sunlight into energy.”

- **<pull>** → the student raises their hand and asks:
  > “Why do plants need water for that?”

- **<grab>** → a quiet student hears the explanation, nods, and writes it down.

---

### 🦅 predator–prey

- **<push>** → a bird issues an alarm call:
  > “Hawk overhead!”

  It broadcasts a danger [claim] to nearby animals — that’s a **<push>**.

- **<pull>** → a squirrel pauses mid-forage, then stands upright and flicks its tail.
  This **posture is a probe** — a signal asking, *“is there danger nearby?”*
  In response, a hawk shifts slightly on its branch.
  The squirrel locks eyes, freezes, and darts into cover.
  This is a **<pull>** — the squirrel *provoked* a revealing signal, *studied it*, and *verified the claim*.

- **<grab>** → a rabbit hears the alarm call and bolts into cover —
  no request, no probe, just rapid **uptake** of the offered [claim] — that’s a **<grab>**.

### 🐦 bird-of-paradise courtship

- **<pull>** → a female perches nearby and performs a head-tilt + wing-flick — a ritualized probe:
  > *"show me your fitness."*
  The male responds with an elaborate display: feathers flared, hopping, vibrating.
  She watches closely, then flies down — a verified [claim] exchange.

- **<push>** → the male later performs his display unprompted, facing the open forest.
  This is a **<push>** — he offers a [claim], watching for attention.

- **<grab>** → another female, hidden nearby, sees the display and swoops in.
  She didn’t signal — she simply **grabbed** the offered [claim].
