## ♻️ ecologist.brief: reversibility and entropy

> this brief defines how **reversibility** interacts with **entropy** in ecological and decision-making systems.
> it explains why reversible choices preserve agency — and why irreversible ones accelerate loss.

### 🔁 reversibility
a **reversible choice** is one whose consequences can be undone or altered
it preserves optionality and keeps future paths open

an **irreversible choice** consumes resources, alters the environment, or forecloses prior options
it commits the actor to a narrowed future

---

### 🌀 entropy
entropy measures the system’s **disorder**, **uncertainty**, or **loss of recoverability**
it tends to increase over time — especially through irreversible actions

---

### ⛓️ relationship

- **reversibility resists entropy**
  reversible choices delay commitment and preserve order
  → more paths stay accessible

- **irreversibility increases entropy**
  irreversible choices lock in change, close options, and increase system disorder
  → fewer future paths remain

---

### 🧠 ecological implication
- actors tend to **prefer reversible choices under uncertainty**
  → to **buffer against entropic loss**
  → to preserve **future agency** in evolving environments
