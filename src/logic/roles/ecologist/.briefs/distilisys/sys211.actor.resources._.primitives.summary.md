## 🌐 ecologist.brief: primitive resources (summary)

> distills the four core resource classes — [time], [energy], [space], and [claim] — into their motive roles.
> each shapes what’s possible, costly, or knowable for actors in a system.

### ⏳ [time]

**what it is**:
a fixed-duration window in which action can occur.
cannot be paused, stored, or regained.

**why it matters**:
- <<save>>[time] → <<gain>>[chance] for future action
- <delay> → <<drop>>[chance] as windows close

**valid effects**:
- ✅ <<save>>[time] — preserve agency and optionality
- ❌ <<gain>> / <<lift>> / <<drop>> — time is immutable

**example**:
<abandon> slow task → <<drop>>[waste] → <<save>>[time] → <<gain>>[chance] to redirect effort

### ⚡ [energy]

**what it is**:
a spendable capacity for work. fuels all action.
finite, depletable, replenishable.

**why it matters**:
- <<gain>>[energy] → <<gain>>[chance] to act
- <<save>>[energy] → extends future agency
- <<drop>>[energy] → <<drop>>[chance] to continue behavior

**valid effects**:
- ✅ <<gain>>, <<save>>
- ❌ <<lift>> (no quality), <<drop>> (only as consequence, not goal)

**example**:
<skipFight> → <<drop>>[waste] → <<save>>[energy] → <<gain>>[chance] to survive

### 📍 [space]

**what it is**:
a bounded field of physical access — defines proximity, reach, and exposure.

**why it matters**:
- <<gain>>[space] → toward resource → <<gain>>[chance]
- <<gain>>[space] → from threat → <<drop>>[threat]
- <<drop>>[space] → <<drop>>[chance] or create safety

**valid effects**:
- ✅ <<gain>>, <<drop>>, <<save>>, <<lift>> — all apply

**polarity flip**:
motive depends on perspective:
- predator: `<<gain>>[space]` → `<<gain>>[chance]` to hunt
- prey: `<<drop>>[space]` → `<<drop>>[threat]` of detection

**example**:
<climb> → <<lift>>[space] → <<drop>>[threat] during flood

---

### 🧠 [claim]

**what it is**:
an internal representational belief held by an actor.
enables reasoning, learning, and coordination.

**why it matters**:
- <<gain>>[claim] → <<gain>>[chance] to act wisely
- <<drop>>[claim] → <<drop>>[threat] of error
- <<lift>>[claim] → increase generality and reuse

**subtypes**:
| cluster       | role                               |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| [lesson]      | learned rule from experience       |
| [assumption]  | unverified belief                  |
| [question]    | gap in knowledge                   |
| [pattern]     | reusable structure or analogy      |

**valid effects**:
- ✅ <<gain>>, <<drop>>, <<save>>, <<lift>> — all apply

**example**:
<debug> → <<drop>>[claim:assumption] → <<drop>>[threat] of failure

📌 summary

| resource | core effect         | key motive paths                                  |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| [time]   | <<save>>            | preserve windows of opportunity                   |
| [energy] | <<gain>>, <<save>>  | enable and extend action                          |
| [space]  | all 4 effects       | control access, exposure, and position            |
| [claim]  | all 4 effects       | shape beliefs to improve reasoning and response   |
