## 🧭 ecologist.brief: motive grammar

> defines the structural **syntax of behavior** — how actors transform pressure into action.
> motive grammar describes how decisions flow through `[resources]`, `<mechanisms>`, and `{drivers}`,
> forms the **behavioral layer** of `distilisys:grammar`, where system motion becomes legible through cause-effect chains.

### 🧬 integration with `distilisys:grammar`

in distilisys, systems are defined by:

- `[resource]` — the things that exist or change
- `<mechanism>` — the actions taken
- `{driver}` — the pressure behind the action

**motive grammar** extends this structure to include outcome force:

\`\`\`text
<mechanism> → <<effect>>[resource] → <<gain>>[chance]
<mechanism> → <<effect>>[resource] → <<drop>>[threat]
\`\`\`

this connects **system shape** to **actor behavior** — showing *why* actions occur.

### 🔤 syntax reference

| unit           | role in system                           | allowed values / structure                            | examples                                            |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `[resource]`   | constraint or currency                   | any observable noun or state                          | [time], [energy], [status], [space]                 |
| `<mechanism>`  | atomic action or procedure               | any atomic verb or transformation                     | <rest>, <signal>, <run>, <cache>                    |
| `<<effect>>`   | motive impact on a resource              | one of `<<gain>>`, `<<drop>>`, `<<save>>`, `<<lift>>` | <<gain>>[chance], <<drop>>[risk]                    |
| `{driver}`     | pressure or motive signal                | one of four canonical forms *(see below)*             | {+incentive:<<save>>[time]}, {-headwind:[friction]} |

---

### 📌 valid `{driver}` forms

drivers express what creates motive pressure. only **four** canonical forms exist:

| form              | meaning                                 | example                                      |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `{+incentive}`    | actor is pulled toward a [chance]        | `[actor]{+incentive:<<save>>[time]}`         |
| `{-decentive}`    | actor is pushed away from a [threat]     | `[actor]{-decentive:<<drop>>[health]}`       |
| `{+tailwind}`     | environment supports action              | `[season]{+tailwind:<<gain>>[customers]}`    |
| `{-headwind}`     | environment resists action               | `[policy]{-headwind:<<gain>>[growth]}`       |

> 📌 every `{driver}` may reference a `<<effect>>[resource]` to make its motive force explicit.

### 🔁 behavioral flow

\`\`\`text
<mechanism>
  ↓
<<effect>>[resource]
  ↓
<<gain>>[chance]     → approach behavior
<<drop>>[threat]     → avoidance behavior
\`\`\`

motive grammar turns static systems into dynamic agents with reasons.

---

### 🧲 core principle

> every [resource] only matters insofar as it helps:
> - **<<gain>>[chance]** — unlock more possible futures
> - **<<drop>>[threat]** — reduce danger or entropy

---

### 🧪 examples

| motive trace | explanation |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| <run> → <<drop>>[delay] → <<save>>[time] → <<gain>>[chance] to escape                     | actor runs to survive   |
| <rest> → <<gain>>[energy] → <<gain>>[chance] to act later                                 | actor recovers agency   |
| <hide> → <<drop>>[visibility] → <<drop>>[threat]                                          | actor evades detection  |
| <signal> → <<lift>>[status] → <<gain>>[chance] to attract mates                           | actor self-promotes     |
| <skipFight> → <<drop>>[waste] → <<save>>[energy] → <<gain>>[chance] to survive lean times | actor avoids drain      |

### ✅ usage in system distillation

- embed motive traces directly in distilisys chains
- tag `<mechanism>`s with their downstream motive
- make **actor pressure** legible alongside structural flow

---

### 📌 motive grammar compresses behavior into a compact syntax:

- **what it changes** → `[resource]`
- **how it changes** → `<mechanism>`
- **why it matters** → `<<effect>>`
- **why it happens** → `{driver}`
- **what it leads to** → `[chance]` or `[threat]`


### 📌 recommendations

- use `<<effect>>[resource]` to describe **why** a step matters
- trace every behavior to ultimately either:
  - **<<gain>>[chance]**
  - **<<drop>>[threat]**
- treat `[chance]` and `[threat]` as root-level outcomes — everything else serves them

### 🧪 summary

| layer         | what it declares              |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| `[resource]`  | what exists or is constrained |
| `<mechanism>` | what acts on it               |
| `<<effect>>`  | what impact results           |
| `{driver}`    | what pressure causes action   |
