## 📍 ecologist.brief: space

> space is the physical field in which all behavior unfolds.
> actors must position themselves to access resources, avoid threats, and reach outcomes.

### 🧱 what it is
a **bounded environment** with constraints on reach, range, proximity, and separation
space defines what’s nearby — and what’s out of reach

---

### 🧲 why it matters

- **proximity enables access**
  <<gain>>[space] (toward resource) → <<gain>>[chance] to act on it

- **distance enables safety**
  <<gain>>[space] (from threat) → <<drop>>[threat]

- **limits create scarcity**
  <<drop>>[space] → <<drop>>[chance] — crowding, enclosure, or separation can block action

---

### 🧭 how [space] drives actors

> space defines **what’s reachable** — every gain or loss of position affects access and danger.
> actors are driven to **optimize position**, **reduce crowding**, or **expand access**.

#### valid drivers

- **<<gain>>[space]** ✅
  expands access to food, mates, cover, or escape paths

- **<<drop>>[space]** ✅
  reduces exposure or narrows territory (can be strategic or forced)
  often used to:
  - <<drop>>[threat]
  - <<save>>[energy]

- **<<lift>>[space]** ✅
  increases the *value* of current position (e.g. elevation, visibility, territory quality)

- **<<save>>[space]** ✅
  preserve access to a known area or niche for future use
  produced by:
  - <mark> territory
  - <cache> resources
  - <guard> boundaries

#### inapplicable

- each effect is applicable

---


#### polarity flip

> the same [space] may have different motive polarities, dependent on the actor's considered

- predator → `<<gain>>[space]` → `<<gain>>[chance]` to hunt
- prey → `<<drop>>[space]` → `<<drop>>[threat]` of being seen

this makes [space] a **polarity-sensitive resource** — its motive value is shaped by actor perspective.

### 🧪 examples

- **approach** watering hole from downwind
  → <move> → <<gain>>[space] (toward resource) → <<gain>>[chance] to drink safely

- **flee** to higher ground during flood
  → <climb> → <<lift>>[space] → <<drop>>[threat]

- **defend** core territory from rival
  → <guard> → <<save>>[space] → <<gain>>[chance] to feed and mate locally

- **avoid** narrow canyon when predators nearby
  → <reroute> → <<drop>>[space] → <<drop>>[threat]
