## ⏳ ecologist.brief: time

> time is a fundamental constraint — finite, irreversible, and always flowing.
> actors cannot gain time, only use it better. motive systems evolve to save time wherever possible.

### 🧱 what it is
a **fixed-duration window** in which things can happen
time cannot be paused, stored, or extended

---

### 🧲 why it matters

- **delay creates decay**
  <delay> → <<drop>>[chance] — chances degrade over time or close altogether

- **more time, more chances**
  <<save>>[time] → <<gain>>[chance] — each unit preserved unlocks another shot

---

### 🧭 how [time] drives actors

> time can’t be controlled — only responded to.
> its scarcity drives actors to **produce <<save>>[time]** to preserve agency and unlock more chances.

#### valid driver

- **<<save>>[time]** ✅
  actors save time by:
  - <<drop>>[delay] — remove lag between intent and outcome
  - <<lift>>[speed] — accelerate actions
  - <<drop>>[waste] — cut effort with poor time return

#### invalid or inapplicable

- **<<gain>>[time]** ❌
  impossible — time cannot be created or recovered

- **<<lift>>[time]**, **<<drop>>[time]** ❌
  inapplicable — time has no quality to enhance or remove

---

### 🧪 examples

- **choose** faster routes to reach food before dark
  → <<drop>>[delay] → <<save>>[time] → <<gain>>[chance] to feed safely

- **reproduce** early to increase generational spread
  → <<drop>>[delay] → <<save>>[time] → <<gain>>[chance] for more offspring

- **abandon** tasks that take too long to complete
  → <<drop>>[waste] → <<save>>[time] → <<gain>>[chance] to redirect effort
