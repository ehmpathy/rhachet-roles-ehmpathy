## 🧬 ecologist.brief: composite resource motives

> composite resources combine or emerge from primitive ones (like [time], [energy], [space], [claim])
> they often serve as strong attractors or threats in ecosystems — shaping how actors behave over time.

### 🤝 relational resources
> shape access to support, reproduction, or influence

- **[mate]** — access to reproduction
  <<gain>>[mate] → <<gain>>[chance] to produce [child]
  shaped by [rank], [signal], [territory]

- **[child]** — lineage continuation
  <<save>>[child] → <<save>>[lineage]
  core driver of nurture, protection, and provisioning behavior

- **[tribe]** — social belonging or collective power
  <<gain>>[tribe] → <<gain>>[chance] to coordinate, defend, or thrive
  actors may also <<drop>>[tribe] to reduce [threat] (e.g., avoid infection)

- **[repute]** — composite of [rank] and [esteem]; a collective belief about an actor’s value or behavior
  <<lift>>[repute] → <<gain>>[chance] for trust, inclusion, or influence
  actor-local [claim], environment-global [effect]

  - **[rank]** — objective social position within a hierarchy
    <<lift>>[rank] → <<gain>>[chance] to access [mate], [food], or [space]

  - **[esteem]** — subjective value or admiration, internal or perceived
    <<gain>>[esteem] → <<gain>>[chance] to act with confidence or attract allies


- **[trust]** — confidence in another actor’s reliability or intent

  trust often emerges from:
  - <<lift>>[repute]
  - <<save>>[claim:pattern] about actor behavior
  - repeated <interaction> or <signal> consistency

  📌 trust is a **relational affordance** —
  a conditional [chance] based on observed history or perceived alignment

  | motive           | effect                                                        |
  |------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
  | <<gain>>[trust]  | → <<gain>>[chance] to coordinate, depend, or share resources  |
  | <<drop>>[trust]  | → <<drop>>[chance] for collaboration or mutual safety         |

### 🛠️ instrumental resources
> enable leverage, durability, or capacity to act

- **[tool]** — external object used to enhance action
  <<gain>>[tool] → <<lift>>[efficiency] → <<save>>[energy]
  <<gain>>[tool] → <<gain>>[option] → <<gain>>[chance]

- **[shelter]** — protection from environment or predators
  <<save>>[shelter] → <<drop>>[threat] of exposure or attack

- **[signal]** — visible or audible marker of identity or intent
  <<lift>>[signal] → <<gain>>[chance] to attract [mate] or warn [tribe]

- **[territory]** — bounded [space] with defensible value
  <<save>>[territory] → <<gain>>[chance] to access [food], [mate], or [shelter]

### 🧠 cognitive resources
> shape future behavior through mental [claim] composites

- **[value]** — internal priority assigned to an outcome, object, or state
  <<gain>>[value] → <<gain>>[chance] to resolve tradeoffs or guide choice

  [value] acts as a **weighting system** for action:
  - clarifies which [goal]s or [claim]s matter most
  - determines how much [energy], [time], or [risk] an actor is willing to invest

  📌 [value] drives **selection** — it governs why an actor prefers one [chance] over another
  often inferred from behavior, [signal]s, or stated [claim]s


- **[goal]** — targeted future outcome held in mind
  <<gain>>[goal] → <<gain>>[chance] to align effort, persist, or coordinate

  a [goal] is a structured, value-laden [claim] that guides future action:
  - [claim:pattern] → model of what's possible
  - [value] → priority assigned
  - [plan] → path toward realization

  📌 [goal] = valued, structured claim about the future


- **[plan]** — future-directed [claim:pattern]
  <<gain>>[plan] → <<gain>>[chance] to achieve [goal]

  [plan]s are shaped by:
  - [value] of outcomes
  - known [claim:pattern]s of steps
  - expected [cost] and [chance] of execution


#### directional motive chain
→ **[value]** → **[goal]** → **[plan]**

each builds upon the last:
- [value] defines **what matters**
- [goal] clarifies **what to aim for**
- [plan] specifies **how to get there**

### 💰 accumulative resources
> stores of value that extend optionality or delay decay

- **[food]** — directly replenishes [energy]
  <<gain>>[food] → <<gain>>[energy] → <<gain>>[chance] to act

- **[cache]** — stored [food] or [tool]
  <<gain>>[cache] → <<save>>[chance] in lean conditions

- **[wealth]** — abstract form of accumulated leverage (esp. in humans)
  <<gain>>[wealth] → <<gain>>[chance] via trade or [rank]

---

### 🔁 insight: motive hierarchy

many composite resources exist **to serve** primitive needs
e.g.
- [tool] → saves [energy]
- [territory] → grants [space]
- [plan] → improves [claim]
- [rank] → unlocks [mate], [food], [tribe]
- [repute] → boosts [tribe], [trust]

> every composite resource ultimately leads back to
> - <<gain>>[chance]
> - <<drop>>[threat]
