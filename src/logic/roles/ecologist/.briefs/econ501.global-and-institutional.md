### 🌍 Tier 5: global and institutional context
**cluster**: rules, incentives, and outcomes

---

### 🎯 goal
explore how **rules, expectations, and context shape economic behavior** — from global development to everyday decision-making.

---

## 🎲 game theory & strategic interaction
**how agents act when outcomes depend on others**

- decisions aren’t made in a vacuum — other people's choices affect your payoff
- key concepts:
  - **payoff matrix** – tracks outcomes for all players
  - **dominant strategy** – best move regardless of what others do
  - **Nash equilibrium** – no one has an incentive to deviate given others' choices

- famous games:
  - **prisoner’s dilemma** – mutual cooperation is better, but self-interest leads to worse outcome
  - **coordination games** – success depends on aligning actions (e.g., driving side of the road, tech standards)

💡 game theory explains pricing wars, political negotiation, market entry, and more

---

## 🏛 institutions & property rights
**rules that shape incentives and transaction costs**

- **institutions** = formal and informal “rules of the game”
  → laws, norms, contracts, enforcement mechanisms

- **property rights** define who owns what and under what terms
  → clarity and enforcement reduce conflict and unlock investment

💡 strong institutions reduce friction, encourage trust, and attract capital
💡 weak or corrupt institutions raise risk and discourage long-term growth

---

## 🌱 development economics
**why some nations grow and others stagnate**

- looks at persistent gaps in wealth, health, and opportunity
- key barriers:
  - lack of infrastructure
  - weak institutions
  - poor education or health systems
  - dependency on resource exports
  - corruption and conflict

- solutions involve:
  - **aid** (targeted, conditional, or direct)
  - **microfinance** and entrepreneurship
  - **policy reform** and capacity building
  - **community-driven development**

💡 development is multi-dimensional — not just about income, but human well-being

---

## 🧠 behavioral economics
**bounded rationality, heuristics, and irrational tendencies**

- challenges the rational choice model
- key findings:
  - **loss aversion** – losses hurt more than gains feel good
  - **present bias** – short-term rewards outweigh long-term gains
  - **anchoring** – decisions are swayed by irrelevant reference points
  - **default effects** – people stick with pre-set options

- used in:
  - **nudges** (opt-out savings plans, organ donation defaults)
  - **policy design** that aligns with real human behavior

💡 behavior is shaped by emotion, framing, fatigue, and habit — not just logic

---

### 🔁 mental model
> economic outcomes are never just about prices or math — they’re shaped by **rules, relationships, psychology, and power**.
> to understand real economies, you must also understand **the systems people move within**.
