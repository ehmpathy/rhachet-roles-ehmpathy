# usecases (distilisys format)

## format

each usecase is wrapped in a `<sys>` block and contains:
- a comment block with `.who`, `.what`, and `.why`
- a distilisys system line describing the mechanism, inputs, and drivers

example:

<sys>
/**
 * .who = [actor or user]
 * .what = [action or mechanism]
 * .why = [why this matters to them]
 */
[actor]<mechanism>({ input? })
  => {
    desire: [short-term intent],
    driver: [core motivator], // e.g. money++, trust, speed
    priority: musthave | hugetohave | nicetohave | optional | edgecase,
    gain: [benefit to the actor],
    cost: low | med | high
  }
</sys>
