# 📘 ecologist.brief: core resources that motivate behavior

> this brief defines the fundamental **resources** that shape how actors behave in an ecosystem.
> every motive traces back to these core constraints or opportunities — either to **gain**, **save**, **lift**, or **drop** them.

## 🌐 primitives (physics + math)

these are **universal** — they exist in all systems, living or not.
they are the root-level currencies of action, effort, and decision.

---

- **time**
  - **what**: finite duration in which things can happen
  - **why it matters**: delay creates decay; time limits every opportunity
  - **examples**:
    - choosing a faster route to reach food before dark
    - reproducing early to increase generational spread
    - abandoning a task if it takes too long to complete

---

- **energy**
  - **what**: capacity to do work or cause change
  - **why it matters**: all action burns energy; no energy, no behavior
  - **examples**:
    - consuming high-calorie food to fuel migration
    - resting during hot hours to conserve energy
    - competing only when the energetic payoff is worth the cost

---

- **space**
  - **what**: access to physical area or position
  - **why it matters**: space enables access, control, and safety
  - **examples**:
    - defending territory to ensure resource access
    - migrating to new zones with less competition
    - selecting nest sites with optimal shelter and visibility

---

- **risk**
  - **what**: uncertainty in outcome or exposure to harm
  - **why it matters**: high risk pressures behavior toward caution or adaptation
  - **examples**:
    - avoiding open spaces to reduce predation chance
    - choosing familiar food sources over novel ones
    - altering behavior after a near-death encounter

## 🧬 composites (evolved from primitives)

these are **biological or behavioral constructs** that combine primitives into more complex tradeoffs.
they explain how real organisms actually act in the wild.

---

- **nutrients**
  - **what**: essential compounds for growth and repair
  - **why it matters**: necessary for survival, regeneration, and reproduction
  - **examples**:
    - seeking mineral-rich soil or salt licks
    - diversifying diet to access different micronutrients
    - consuming decaying organic matter for essential compounds

---

- **territory**
  - **what**: controlled space containing other resources
  - **why it matters**: enables persistent access and blocks threats
  - **examples**:
    - marking and patrolling boundaries
    - fighting off intruders to protect food caches
    - choosing strategic ground for nest placement

---

- **levers**
  - **what**: reusable mechanisms that amplify power or reduce effort (tools, habits)
  - **why it matters**: allow efficient, repeatable action
  - **examples**:
    - using a stick to extract insects
    - following a habitual path to water
    - caching food to avoid repeated foraging

---

- **foresight**
  - **what**: ability to anticipate future outcomes using pattern
  - **why it matters**: helps avoid risk, optimize timing, and reduce waste
  - **examples**:
    - migrating before a seasonal storm
    - delaying reproduction in poor years
    - storing food in advance of winter

---

- **repute**
  - **what**: perception of reliability or value within a group
  - **why it matters**: reduces social risk and increases collaboration, access, or mates
  - **examples**:
    - grooming behavior to maintain alliances
    - ritual displays to signal strength or stability
    - consistent cooperation to earn future favors

---

- **legacy**
  - **what**: persistent influence beyond lifespan
  - **why it matters**: allows reproduction, teaching, or structural continuity
  - **examples**:
    - passing on genes through offspring
    - teaching young foragers survival patterns
    - building long-term structures like beaver dams

## 🎯 how this is used

when evaluating an **actor’s option**, ask:

1. what **core resources** are affected by this option?
2. does it help the actor **gain**, **save**, **lift**, or **drop** anything they care about?
3. which **composite resource** does it serve or threaten?

> this lets us **trace motives** back to what actually matters in the ecosystem — not just what seems appealing on the surface.
