## 📐 ecologist.brief: naming symmetry is rare, not assumed

### .what
symmetry is a naming pattern where two terms **align across structure, domain, and role polarity** — creating a recognizable pair.

### .why
true symmetry helps readers **spot relationships quickly**, especially for mirrored actions or states (e.g. input/output, draft/final).
but symmetry is **rare by default**. most related terms are **not** symmetric. forcing it introduces noise and confusion.

---

### 💡 principle
**symmetry is descriptive — not prescriptive.**
terms either **are** symmetric, or they’re not.
naming should reflect reality — not force a pattern.

---

### ✅ required overlap

for two terms to be symmetric, they must **share at least one common token**
→ in **the same position** (prefix, stem, or suffix)

| ✅ `getStatus` / `setStatus`     → shared suffix: `Status`
| ✅ `job-requested` / `job-scheduled` → shared prefix: `job`
| 🚫 `crewAvailability` / `appointmentSchedule` → no shared term in same position

→ **no overlap = no symmetry**

---

## 📏 symmetry dimensions

For two terms to be symmetric, they must align in all three:

### 1. **structure symmetry**
> same naming form — `noun-noun`, `verbObject`, `adj-noun`, etc.

| ✅ `getBalance` / `setBalance`
| ✅ `guest-invited` / `guest-declined`
| 🚫 `trackOrder` / `customerSignup`

---

### 2. **domain symmetry**
> same real-world scope — e.g. time, jobs, crew, money

| ✅ `draftVersion` / `finalVersion`
| ✅ `orderSubmitted` / `orderCancelled`
| 🚫 `crewAvailability` / `appointmentStatus`

---

### 3. **role symmetry**
> opposite function — e.g. input/output, open/close, start/end

| ✅ `inputData` / `outputData`
| ✅ `earnedAmount` / `spentAmount`
| 🚫 `paymentStatus` / `refundRequest`

---

## 🧪 test for symmetry

> “do these two terms match in **structure**, belong to the **same domain**, and differ only by **role**?”

if **any** dimension fails, they’re **not symmetric**.

---

## 🔁 types of symmetry

Symmetry comes in two **types**, depending on how tight the match is:

### 🔸 rhyme symmetry
> terms **look or feel** paired — even if not strict opposites or mirrors.

| ✅ `pickupTime` / `dropoffTime`
| ✅ `sendInvite` / `receiveInvite`
| ✅ `moneyIn` / `moneyOut`

- pairs feel balanced due to rhythm, phrasing, or framing
- not exact mirrors, but **visually or semantically complementary**

---

### 🔸 polar symmetry
> terms are **true opposites** in role — with perfect structure + domain match.

| ✅ `beganTime` / `endedTime`
| ✅ `openFunds` / `heldFunds`
| ✅ `allowRequest` / `blockRequest`

- strongest and clearest kind of symmetry
- occurs when all 3 dimensions align **precisely**

---

### 🚫 what symmetry is **not**

- not just appearing in the same system or workflow
- not just being causally linked
- not just being related in meaning

**example:**
`scheduleWindow` vs `crewAvailability`
→ related concepts, but **not symmetric** (structure mismatch, no clear polarity)

---

## 🧠 bottom line

- most terms are **related**, not symmetric
- symmetry is **rare**, but powerful when true
- treat it as an **opt-in signal**, not a default

> if it doesn't pass the 3-part test, it's not symmetry — it's proximity.
