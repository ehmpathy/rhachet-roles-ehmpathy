🌱 why actions come first:
ecologists observe patterns in the wild before assigning roles

they start with what’s happening — migration, feeding, mating, competition

only then do they ask who’s doing it and why

🧭 distilled principle:
observe the behavior → infer the actors → model the pressures

🧪 example:
an ecologist doesn’t begin with “the lion.”
they begin with:

“something hunts gazelles here during the dry season”

“it stalks from shade, strikes at dusk”

then they identify the lion

🧵 in domain distillation:
first extract interactions (posts, bookings, approvals, payments…)

then identify the real-world actors based on who initiates and who responds

then model their drivers, stakes, and frictions
