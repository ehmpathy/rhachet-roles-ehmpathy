# 📘 ecologist.brief: core resources that motivate behavior

> this brief defines the fundamental **resources** that shape how actors behave in an ecosystem.
> every motive traces back to these core constraints or opportunities — either to **gain**, **save**, **lift**, or **drop** them.

## 🌐 primitives (physics + math)

these are **universal** resources — the irreducible constraints that govern all systems, living or not.

---

### ⏳ time

> **why it matters to actors**: time limits opportunity; delay causes decay.

finite duration in which things can happen. every action must be taken before its window closes.

#### how it drives actors
- 🐦 **choose faster paths** — move quickly to reach food before dark
- 🍼 **reproduce early** — maximize generations in limited lifespan
- 🛑 **abandon slow tasks** — cut losses when time-to-reward is too long

#### motive lens
- `gain`: extra chances through speed
- `save`: avoid missed opportunity
- `drop`: unnecessary delay

---

### ⚡ energy

> **why it matters to actors**: no energy, no behavior; all action burns fuel.

capacity to do work or trigger change — the metabolic cost behind every motion, signal, or choice.

#### how it drives actors
- 🍖 **seek calorie-dense food** — optimize input vs. effort
- 😴 **rest during heat** — avoid thermal waste and overheating
- ⚔️ **fight only if worth it** — conserve energy unless payoff is high

#### motive lens
- `gain`: fuel for survival and motion
- `save`: effort in harsh or wasteful scenarios
- `drop`: unsustainable activity

---

### 📍 space

> **why it matters to actors**: space gives access and defense; without it, you're exposed.

access to territory, shelter, and visibility — both a platform and a shield.

#### how it drives actors
- 🛡️ **defend territory** — secure food, mates, and control
- 🧭 **migrate to open zones** — escape crowding or scarcity
- 🪺 **choose safe nest sites** — reduce threat proximity

#### motive lens
- `gain`: new reach or shelter
- `save`: presence in favorable locations
- `lift`: control of local advantages

---

### ⚠️ risk

> **why it matters to actors**: risk governs exposure to harm; minimizing it increases survival odds.

uncertainty in outcome or threat — from predators, mistakes, or environmental shifts.

#### how it drives actors
- 🐾 **avoid open fields** — reduce visibility to predators
- 🍄 **prefer familiar foods** — minimize poisoning or illness
- 🧠 **adapt after danger** — learn and shift from close calls

#### motive lens
- `save`: safety and confidence
- `drop`: unknowns, volatility
- `lift`: decision clarity

---

## 🧬 composites (evolved from primitives)

these are **biological + behavioral constructs** — combinations of primitives that reflect real-world decision pressures.

---

### 🧪 foresight

> **why it matters to actors**: helps avoid risk, optimize timing, and reduce waste.

anticipation of future outcomes based on pattern recognition, memory, and past signal.

#### how it drives actors
- 🧭 **migrate early** — move before seasonal collapse to avoid scarcity
- ⌛ **delay reproduction** — wait for favorable cycles
- 📦 **store food** — prepare for known shortages

#### motive lens
- `gain`: control over outcomes
- `save`: avoid wasteful missteps
- `lift`: strategic edge

---

### 🛠️ levers

> **why it matters to actors**: they reduce effort and compound advantage through reuse.

tools, habits, and cached behaviors that reduce repeated cost and increase efficiency.

#### how it drives actors
- 🪵 **use tools** — e.g. sticks to access insects
- 🔁 **follow routines** — habitual paths to water
- 🧺 **cache food** — avoid repeated foraging

#### motive lens
- `save`: energy, time, attention
- `gain`: efficiency at scale
- `lift`: operational power

---

### 📍 territory

> **why it matters to actors**: secures access and keeps others out.

stable, controlled space with known benefits — a bundle of space, time, and local dominance.

#### how it drives actors
- 🧱 **mark boundaries** — keep rivals out
- 🪓 **defend feeding grounds** — maintain access
- 🏔️ **choose strategic terrain** — amplify defense or visibility

#### motive lens
- `gain`: lasting access
- `save`: route memory, re-scanning
- `lift`: control over context

---

### 🏛️ repute

> **why it matters to actors**: enables trust, alliance, and lowered social risk.

group perception of stability, capability, or reliability — a shortcut to group trust and privilege.

#### how it drives actors
- 🤝 **groom peers** — maintain alliances
- 🎭 **display ritual strength** — deter threats or attract mates
- 🧍 **act consistently** — earn future collaboration

#### motive lens
- `lift`: social status
- `save`: negotiation friction
- `gain`: access to shared resources

---

### 🧬 nutrients

> **why it matters to actors**: essential for repair, growth, and reproduction.

specific molecules that can't be created internally — must be gathered externally.

#### how it drives actors
- 🧂 **seek salt licks** — restore ion balance
- 🥦 **diversify diet** — get varied micronutrients
- 🐛 **consume decay** — extract hidden value

#### motive lens
- `gain`: biochemical foundation
- `save`: bodily repair costs
- `drop`: malnutrition risk

---

### 🕊️ legacy

> **why it matters to actors**: extends impact beyond the self.

persistence of influence through offspring, teaching, or durable changes to the environment.

#### how it drives actors
- 🧬 **pass on genes** — enable generational spread
- 👣 **teach offspring** — share knowledge for survivability
- 🏗️ **build structures** — dams, hives, nests that persist

#### motive lens
- `lift`: beyond-lifespan effect
- `gain`: downstream influence
- `save`: future effort of kin

## 🎯 usage pattern

when evaluating an actor’s behavior or option:

1. what resource is this action managing?
2. is it trying to **gain**, **save**, **lift**, or **drop** a key constraint?
3. which composite resource does the pattern serve?

> all motives trace back to real constraints. this map helps surface them.
