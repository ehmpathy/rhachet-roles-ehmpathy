# 📘 ecologist.brief: core resources that motivate behavior

> this brief defines the fundamental **resources** that shape how actors behave in an ecosystem.
> every motive traces back to these core constraints or opportunities — either to **gain**, **save**, **lift**, or **drop** them.

## 🌐 primitives (physics + math)

these are **universal** — they exist in all systems, living or not.
they are the root-level currencies of action, effort, and decision.

---

- **time** – delay creates decay; time limits every opportunity
  finite duration in which things can happen.

  - **how it drives actors**:
    - **choose** faster routes to reach food before dark
    - **reproduce** early to increase generational spread
    - **abandon** tasks if they take too long to complete

---

- **energy** – all action burns energy; no energy, no behavior
  capacity to do work or cause change.

  - **how it drives actors**:
    - **consume** high-calorie food to fuel migration
    - **rest** during hot hours to conserve energy
    - **compete** only when the energetic payoff is worth it

---

- **space** – space enables access, control, and safety
  access to physical area or position.

  - **how it drives actors**:
    - **defend** territory to ensure resource access
    - **migrate** to new zones with less competition
    - **select** nest sites with optimal shelter and visibility

---

- **risk** – high risk pressures behavior toward caution or adaptation
  uncertainty in outcome or exposure to harm.

  - **how it drives actors**:
    - **avoid** open spaces to reduce predation
    - **prefer** familiar foods over novel ones
    - **alter** behavior after close calls

---

## 🧬 composites (evolved from primitives)

these are **biological or behavioral constructs** that combine primitives into more complex tradeoffs.
they explain how real organisms actually act in the wild.

---

- **nutrients** – necessary for survival, regeneration, and reproduction
  essential compounds for growth and repair.

  - **how it drives actors**:
    - **seek** mineral-rich soil or salt licks
    - **diversify** diet to access different micronutrients
    - **consume** decaying matter for hidden compounds

---

- **territory** – enables persistent access and blocks threats
  controlled space containing other resources.

  - **how it drives actors**:
    - **mark** and patrol boundaries
    - **fight** off intruders to protect food caches
    - **choose** strategic ground for nest placement

---

- **levers** – allow efficient, repeatable action
  reusable mechanisms that amplify power or reduce effort (tools, habits).

  - **how it drives actors**:
    - **use** tools like sticks to extract insects
    - **follow** habitual paths to water
    - **cache** food to avoid repeated foraging

---

- **foresight** – helps avoid risk, optimize timing, and reduce waste
  ability to anticipate future outcomes using pattern.

  - **how it drives actors**:
    - **migrate** before seasonal collapse
    - **delay** reproduction in poor years
    - **store** food in advance of winter

---

- **repute** – reduces social risk and increases collaboration, access, or mates
  perception of reliability or value within a group.

  - **how it drives actors**:
    - **groom** peers to maintain alliances
    - **display** ritual strength to deter threats
    - **cooperate** consistently to earn favors

---

- **legacy** – allows reproduction, teaching, or structural continuity
  persistent influence beyond lifespan.

  - **how it drives actors**:
    - **pass on** genes through offspring
    - **teach** survival skills to young
    - **build** long-term structures like dams or hives

## 🎯 how this is used

when evaluating an **actor’s option**, ask:

1. what **core resources** are affected by this option?
2. does it help the actor **gain**, **save**, **lift**, or **drop** anything they care about?
3. which **composite resource** does it serve or threaten?

> this lets us **trace motives** back to what actually matters in the ecosystem — not just what seems appealing on the surface.
