# 📘 ecologist.brief: core resources that motivate behavior

> this brief defines the fundamental **resources** that shape how actors behave in an ecosystem.
> every motive traces back to these core constraints or opportunities — either to **gain**, **save**, **lift**, or **drop** them.

## 🌐 primitives (physics + math)

these are **universal** — they exist in all systems, living or not.
they are the root-level currencies of action, effort, and decision.

---

### ⏳ time
- **what**: finite duration in which things can happen
- **why it matters**: delay creates decay; time limits every opportunity
- **examples**:
  - **choose** faster routes to reach food before dark
  - **reproduce** early to increase generational spread
  - **abandon** tasks that take too long to complete

---

### ⚡ energy
- **what**: capacity to do work or cause change
- **why it matters**: fuels behavior; no energy, no action
- **examples**:
  - **consume** high-calorie food to fuel migration
  - **rest** during hot hours to conserve fuel
  - **compete** only when the payoff exceeds cost

---

### 📍 space
- **what**: access to physical area or position
- **why it matters**: enables access, control, and safety
- **examples**:
  - **defend** territory to secure resources
  - **migrate** to zones with less competition
  - **select** nest sites with optimal shelter

---

### ⚠️ risk
- **what**: uncertainty in outcome or exposure to harm
- **why it matters**: steers caution and drives adaptation
- **examples**:
  - **avoid** open spaces to reduce predation
  - **prefer** familiar food over unknowns
  - **adapt** after near-death encounters

---

## 🧬 composites (evolved from primitives)

these are **biological or behavioral constructs** that combine primitives into more complex tradeoffs.
they explain how real organisms actually act in the wild.

---

### 🍽️ nutrients
- **what**: compounds required for growth and repair
- **why it matters**: drives survival, regeneration, and reproduction
- **examples**:
  - **seek** mineral-rich soil or salt licks
  - **diversify** diet for broader nutrient access
  - **consume** decaying matter for key compounds

---

### 🏞️ territory
- **what**: controlled space containing other resources
- **why it matters**: secures access and blocks threats
- **examples**:
  - **mark** and patrol boundaries
  - **repel** intruders to protect caches
  - **position** nests for strategic advantage

---

### 🛠️ levers
- **what**: reusable mechanisms that amplify effort or reduce cost
- **why it matters**: enables efficient, repeatable action
- **examples**:
  - **use** sticks to extract insects
  - **follow** habitual paths to water
  - **cache** food to skip future foraging

---

### 🧪 foresight
- **what**: anticipation of future outcomes using pattern
- **why it matters**: reduces risk and improves timing
- **examples**:
  - **migrate** before seasonal storms
  - **delay** reproduction in poor years
  - **store** food ahead of scarcity

---

### 🏛️ repute
- **what**: perceived reliability or value within a group
- **why it matters**: boosts access, trust, and cooperation
- **examples**:
  - **groom** peers to maintain alliances
  - **display** strength through ritual
  - **cooperate** to earn future favors

---

### 🧬 legacy
- **what**: persistent influence beyond lifespan
- **why it matters**: enables lineage, learning, and structure
- **examples**:
  - **pass** on genes through offspring
  - **teach** survival strategies to young
  - **build** long-lasting structures like dams

## 🎯 how this is used

when evaluating an **actor’s option**, ask:

1. what **core resources** are affected by this option?
2. does it help the actor **gain**, **save**, **lift**, or **drop** anything they care about?
3. which **composite resource** does it serve or threaten?

> this lets us **trace motives** back to what actually matters in the ecosystem — not just what seems appealing on the surface.
