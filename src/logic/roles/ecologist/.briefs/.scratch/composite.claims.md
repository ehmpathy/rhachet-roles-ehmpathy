## 🧠 ecologist.brief: composite claims

> [composite claims] are **structured mental constructs** — built from simpler [claim]s like [lesson], [assumption], [question], or [pattern].
> they form the **scaffolding of complex thought**, enabling planning, coordination, and system design.
> they’re how actors *think in systems* — combining fragments of understanding into usable guidance.

### 🧱 what they are

composite claims are **multi-part belief structures** used to:

- predict multi-step outcomes
- justify or critique behaviors
- organize scattered claims into coherent models

they are **held**, **shared**, or **stored** — and may evolve with new evidence.

### 🧩 core composite claim types

| type              | what it composes                           | why it matters                                   | example                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **[model]**       | structured system of [pattern]s or [lesson]s | guides prediction and response                   | “supply rises → price drops → demand rises”                            |
| **[belief]**      | stable set of [assumption]s or [lesson]s     | anchors judgment or behavior                     | “they’re always late”                                                  |
| **[theory]**      | explanation built from [pattern]s + [claim]s | enables abstract reasoning or foresight          | “competition shapes evolution”                                         |
| **[plan]**        | causal sequence of [claim]s → [resource]s    | organizes future action                          | “we’ll post flyers → get calls → book jobs”                            |
| **[frame]**       | lens through which [claim]s are interpreted  | influences motive polarity and decision paths    | “the market is a battlefield”                                          |
| **[hypothesis]**  | testable [assumption] + predicted [pattern]  | used to validate or reject models                | “if prices rise, sales will drop”                                      |
| **[narrative]**   | timeline of [event] claims or [pattern]s     | encodes meaning, cause, or consequence           | “we took a risk, failed, learned, and recovered”                       |
| **[protocol]**    | reusable [plan] codified for group use       | ensures consistent execution or response         | “when customer cancels → send refund → archive job”                    |

### 🧭 how they work

> composite claims increase cognitive leverage.
> by aggregating known claims into **higher-order structures**, actors can plan, coordinate, and adapt faster.

#### common operations

- **<simulate>** → creates or tests a [plan] or [theory]
- **<compare>** → evaluates competing [belief]s or [model]s
- **<revise>** → modifies a [frame] or [protocol] after failure
- **<distill>** → compresses [pattern]s into a single [model]

### 🧪 examples

- <simulate> → <<gain>>[claim:plan] → <<gain>>[chance] to prepare
- <reflect> → <<lift>>[claim:frame] → <<gain>>[chance] to reframe choices
- <debug> → <<drop>>[claim:belief] → <<drop>>[threat] of mistaken trust
- <compare> → <<gain>>[claim:theory] → <<gain>>[chance] to explain events
- <distill> → <<lift>>[claim:protocol] →
