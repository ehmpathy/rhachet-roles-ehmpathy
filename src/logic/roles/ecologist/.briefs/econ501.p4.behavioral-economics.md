## `.brief.econ501.behavioral-economics`

### 🧠 topic: behavioral economics
**bounded rationality, heuristics, and irrational tendencies**

---

### 🎯 goal
understand how **real people actually behave** — not as perfect calculators, but as emotional, shortcut-using humans prone to bias, habit, and context effects.

---

### 🧠 beyond rational choice

- traditional economics assumes people are **rational optimizers**
- behavioral economics says: not always
  → we have **limited attention**, **imperfect willpower**, and **emotional reactions**

💡 we often choose what feels right, not what **is** right on paper

---

### 🧪 key behavioral patterns

#### **loss aversion**
- losses feel **twice as painful** as equivalent gains feel good
→ people avoid risks even when upside is worth it

#### **present bias**
- we **overvalue immediate rewards**, undervalue the future
→ procrastination, overspending, under-saving

#### **anchoring**
- decisions are skewed by irrelevant starting points
→ e.g., seeing a $200 shirt makes a $100 one seem cheap

#### **default effects**
- people tend to stick with **pre-set options**
→ auto-enrollment boosts savings, organ donation rates

---

### 🎯 applied behavioral tools

#### **nudges**
- small design tweaks that guide better choices without removing freedom
  - auto opt-in (savings, benefits)
  - smart defaults (green energy plans)
  - reminders and framing (vaccine text messages)

#### **choice architecture**
- how options are presented affects decisions
→ fewer choices = less overload
→ framing gains vs. losses shifts behavior

---

### 📍 real-world examples

- retirement plans with default contributions → more savings
- calorie counts on menus → healthier eating
- donation ask framed as “$1/day” vs. “$30/month” → higher conversions
- limited-time offers → trigger urgency and FOMO

---

### 🚫 common traps we fall into

- trusting gut feelings over data
- sticking with bad choices due to sunk costs
- avoiding change, even when beneficial
- misjudging probabilities (lotteries, insurance)

---

### 🔁 mental model
> behavioral economics reminds us: **we're not robots** — we're biased, emotional, and shaped by context.
> better outcomes come from designing systems that work **with**, not against, real human nature.


---

## 🧠 strategic use cases of behavioral economics
**non-obvious but powerful applications in the real world**

---

### 💰 1. boosting retirement savings with default design
- setting **default contribution rates** (e.g., 6%) drastically increases participation
- most people don’t opt out or adjust
→ behavior driven by **inertia**, not intent

💡 use in HR, pension design, financial planning


### 🧾 2. framing to increase tax compliance
- messages like “**9 out of 10 people in your area already paid**”
→ taps into **social norms** and guilt
→ outperforms penalty reminders

💡 used by governments to improve voluntary compliance


### 💡 3. energy use reduction via peer comparison
- showing homeowners how their energy use compares to neighbors
→ triggers **competitive instincts and social pressure**
→ more effective than financial incentives alone

💡 usecase: utilities, smart home dashboards, climate campaigns


### 🍽 4. changing food choices with placement, not rules
- placing healthy items at eye level or first in line
→ increases uptake **without removing choice**
→ works better than education or labels alone

💡 cafeteria design, grocery stores, school lunch programs


### 📈 5. increasing conversion through chunking & anchoring
- breaking a price into **daily or weekly terms**
  → “just $1/day” feels easier than “$30/month”
- placing an expensive decoy next to mid-tier item
  → makes the middle choice feel like a deal

💡 use in subscription pricing, fundraising, SaaS plans


### 💬 6. structuring decisions to reduce regret and dropout
- offering a “pause my subscription” button instead of “cancel”
→ leverages **status quo bias**
→ preserves revenue and gives users a soft exit

💡 usecase: churn reduction in memberships, apps, and media


### 🎓 7. motivating learning and training through **progress framing**
- “you’ve completed 3 of 5 lessons” > “2 left”
→ taps into **goal gradient effect**: motivation increases as the end approaches

💡 used in edtech, onboarding flows, productivity apps


### 🔁 mental model
> smart systems don’t fight human bias — they **account for it**.
> by applying behavioral economics, we can **unlock better outcomes** in finance, health, sustainability, education, and beyond — not by force, but by **thoughtful design**.
