todo: declare a brief that explains why we prefer to design systems w/ declarative instead of imperative

e.g.,
- easier to use
- easier to read
- easier to write
- easier to maintain


adds a little more upfront work in how to translate the declarations into imperative instructions, but its worth it, as that framework helps you abstract away the technical.domain details and keeps you in the behavioral.domain details instead, as desired

remember: technical.domain work only adds value to developers, not to real people. we want to distribute value to real people
- developer use is temporary -> system builders
- real folk use is forever -> system engagers
