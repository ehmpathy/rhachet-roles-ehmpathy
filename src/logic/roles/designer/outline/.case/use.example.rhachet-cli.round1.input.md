i need to outline a design for a npm typescript cli which calls an existingp rocedure within my repo

the product spec is

1. register the "roles" and "skills" that we can access (w/ readme's)
2. invoke the roles and skills via cli (e.g., `npx rhachet -r mechanic -s produce -t target/file/path -a "the ask to execute against`)
