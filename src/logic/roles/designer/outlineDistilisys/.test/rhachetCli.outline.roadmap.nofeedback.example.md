1. define domain roles and skills types
   .why
      .needed: establish foundational domain types for roles and skills which are integral to the system's operation
      .ordered: central to the functioning of the CLI and must be defined prior to implementing CLI registration mechanisms
   .where
      .layer: domain
      .pathExample: src/domain/objects/RoleSkillTypes.ts
   .what
     .contract.desired
       input = none
       output = { Role, Skill } types with associated metadata and readme
     .change.required
       - create TypeScript interfaces for Role and Skill with appropriate fields
       - include metadata fields like description and links to detailed readme documentation

2. implement registration mechanism for roles and skills in the cli codebase
   .why
      .needed: allows the CLI to recognize and register available roles and skills at runtime
      .ordered: relies on the domain definition of roles and skills to structure registration logic
   .where
      .layer: logic
      .pathExample: src/logic/registerRolesSkills.ts
   .what
     .contract.desired
       input = { Role, Skill } definitions from domain layer
       output = registration of roles and skills in the CLI system
     .change.required
       - develop a registration function that consumes Role and Skill types to populate the CLI's internal structures
       - ensure registration includes linking to the corresponding readme files

3. create command line interface using npm cli framework
   .why
      .needed: provides the user-facing interaction layer to access and utilize roles and skills via command line
      .ordered: builds on the domain and logic layers to present the final user interface
   .where
      .layer: contract
      .pathExample: src/contract/cli
   .what
     .contract.desired
       input = arguments and options from command line
       output = execution of the desired skills based on the specified roles
     .change.required
       - integrate an npm package like yargs or commander to parse command line arguments
       - setup CLI commands that map to registered roles and skills, parse user input, and invoke the appropriate mechanisms in the logic layer

4. detail usage instructions and examples in the CLI's readme
   .why
      .needed: to provide users with clear guidance on how to use the CLI effectively
      .ordered: should be completed last as it summarizes the functional aspects of all previous layers
   .where
      .layer: contract
      .pathExample: src/contract/cli/README.md
   .what
     .contract.desired
       input = details of all commands and options supported by the CLI
       output = detailed usage instructions and examples for end users
     .change.required
       - document each command, its purpose, possible options, and examples of valid usage
       - include troubleshooting tips and links to further support or documentation
```
This roadmap provides a clear, layered approach to building the desired CLI system, structured to ensure each component is defined and depends only on the layers before it.
