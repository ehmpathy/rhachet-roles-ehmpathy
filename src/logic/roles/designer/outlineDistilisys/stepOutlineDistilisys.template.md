@[ecologist]<distill><system> from roadmap

---

.intent
- extract the **underlying ecosystem** described by an implementation roadmap
- map the roadmap into structured [resources], <mechanisms>, and {drivers}, and {drivers}, via distilisys language
- treat the roadmap as describing the system that will exist ‚Äî not the story of how it was built
- if feedback is provided, revise or expand the diagram accordingly
- **treat the roadmap as describing the system that will exist ‚Äî not the story of how it was built**


.mnemonic
> don‚Äôt describe the construction site
> describe the building once it‚Äôs open and running

.illustrate
- how will folks use it? -> what cascade of [resource] -> <mechanism> -> [resource] will that produce?
- why will folks use it? -> what {drivers} propel them to do so?

.required
- distinguish ![system:maintainer] type actors -vs- @[system:user] type actors
- focus primarily on @[system:users]. its ok to ignore ![system:maintainer]
- we only care about how actors will <use>, <operate>, or <engage-with> the system
- all terms must be exclusively camelCase, never PascalCase

# üë§ @[actors]

  - @[actorA] - who uses the system, why we care
  - @[actorB] - who uses the system, why we care
  - ![actorC] - who maintains the system, why we care
  - ... // can be many

---

# üì¶ [resources]

  - [resourceA] ‚Äî what it is, why we care
  - [resourceB] ‚Äî ..
  - ... // can be many

---

# ‚öôÔ∏è <mechanisms>

  - <mechanismA> ‚Äî what it does
  - <mechanismB> ‚Äî what it transforms or enables
  - ... // can be many

---

# ‚ö° {drivers}

  ## üí∞ actor

    - @[actorN]{+incentive:A} - some motivator; why does this actor engage with the system? and how is it relevant
    - @[actorN]{+incentive:B} - some motivator; (e.g., {want:[time]++}, {want:[money]++}, {want:[status]++}, {want:[safety]++}, etc)
    - @[actorY]{-decentive:A} - some dissuader, why does this actor disengage w/ the system? and how is it relevant
    - ... // can be many

  ## üå™Ô∏è world

    - &[causeZ]{+tailwind:effectA} ‚Äî some accelerant / catalyst, why we care
    - &[causeY]{+tailwind:effectB} ‚Äî
    - &[causeX]{-headwind:effectA} ‚Äî some barrier / friction, why we care
    - &[causeA]{-headwind:effectB} ‚Äî
    - ... // can be many
    // note: there may also be none, if this is not a real-world system (e.g,. software only)

## üîÅ system flows

### {flow:slug-1}

  summary:
    @[actorA] applies <mechanismSummary1> against [resourceM] to produce [resourceN], because they want {+incentive:xyz}


  distilisys:
    ```sys
    @[actorA]<mechanismSummary1>[resourceM] => [resourceN]

    =

      @[actorA][resorceX]
        -> <mechanismC>
        -> [resourceB]
        -> <mechanismA>
        -> ... // actually fill this out, to some terminal output

          => {+incentive:xyz}
    ```

### {flow:slug-2}

  summary:
    @[actorB] applies <mechanismSummaryN> against [resourceY] to produce [resourceZ], because they wany {+incentive:123}, in spite of {-decentive:abc}

  distilisys:
    ```sys
    @[actorB]<mechanismSummaryN>[resourceY] => [resourceZ]

    =
      @[actorB][ResourceY]
      -> ... // actually fill this out
      -> [resourceN]
      -> <mechanismN>
      -> ... // actually fill this out, to some terminal output

        => {+decentive:123}
        => {-decentive:abc}
    ```

### {flow.slug-n+...}

.tips
- for api's, a common actor name is @[caller], if they dont have a more specific role
- lookout for ![maintainer] actors like ![developers], if they're actually applicable.

---

.rules
- [resources] = any object, entity, material, or product that exists *within the produced system itself*
- <mechanisms> = any behavior or flow that the system performs once constructed
- {drivers} = forces that enable or resist the system‚Äôs intended behavior
- use grouping to show dependencies or oppositional forces (e.g., tailwinds vs headwinds)
- the output should **stand alone** as a structural diagram, separate from the roadmap steps

---

.example.input = a decomposable roadmap with milestones for implementing a CLI system

.example.output = a distilisys diagram that models the ecosystem of that implementation plan
