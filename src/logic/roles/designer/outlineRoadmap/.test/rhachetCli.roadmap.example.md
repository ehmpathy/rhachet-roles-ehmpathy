```md
1. Define "Role" and "Skill" data models
   .why
      .needed: Establish core data structures needed for registration and retrieval within the CLI.
      .ordered: Foundational types needed before implementing logic and CLI commands.
   .where
      .layer: domain
      .pathExample: src/domain/models.ts
   .what
     .contract.desired
       input = none
       output = { Role, Skill } types with properties and methods
     .change.required
       - Define TypeScript interfaces for "Role" and "Skill" with relevant attributes.

2. Implement data registration functionality for "Roles" and "Skills"
   .why
      .needed: Allows the system to manage and store role and skill entities.
      .ordered: Needs to be implemented after the base data models to utilize them for storage and retrieval.
   .where
      .layer: logic
      .pathExample: src/logic/registration.ts
   .what
     .contract.desired
       input = { Role, Skill }
       output = success message indicating successful registration
     .change.required
       - Develop functions to register the "Role" and "Skill" objects and save them internally (e.g., in-memory store or a file).

3. Create command line interface setup
   .why
      .needed: Set up the preliminary structure to interact with the module via command line.
      .ordered: CLI framework setup is necessary before implementing specific commands.
   .where
      .layer: infra
      .pathExample: src/cli/cliSetup.ts
   .what
     .contract.desired
       input = commands and options from terminal
       output = appropriate response based on command execution
     .change.required
       - Utilize libraries like Commander.js to set up the basic CLI framework with version, help, and basic structure.

4. Implement "invoke" CLI command
   .why
      .needed: Allows the user to execute tasks through the CLI using defined roles and skills.
      .ordered: After CLI setup and domain data structures are in place to ensure the command utilizes the system correctly.
   .where
      .layer: infra
      .pathExample: src/cli/commands/invoke.js
   .what
     .contract.desired
       input = role name, skill, target file path, execution context
       output = outcome of the executed role's skill on the target
     .change.required
       - Code the CLI command that consumes parameters (role and skill) and triggers corresponding actions.
       - Handle validation and error states, such as undefined roles or skills.

5. Finalize documentation and READMEs for user guidance
   .why
      .needed: Provide end-users and developers with instructions and documentation on how to utilize the CLI.
      .ordered: This should be done last to reflect all implemented features and usage scenarios accurately.
   .where
      .layer: infra
      .pathExample: docs/
   .what
     .contract.desired
       input = none
       output = Complete user documentation and developer READMEs
     .change.required
       - Write comprehensive guides and READMEs, covering installation, configuration, and usage examples of the CLI.
```
This roadmap offers a structured breakdown of phases in the project, arranged from foundational data structures to user-interaction mechanics and documentation, facilitating clear vision and execution guidance.
