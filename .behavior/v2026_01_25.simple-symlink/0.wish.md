our mechanics often struggle to create symlinks

they often think they need to cd into a dir in order to symlink out from it

then, they forget they've cd'd, and have all sorts of headaches


---


instead, we should follow the pattern of sedreplace

and create a simple reusable and self descriptive skill

one that would help even the humans who want to peek at what the mechanic is up to easily understand what the symlink will do


e.g., all from cwd

symlink --at path/to/symlink/file --to path/to/send/readers/to --mode absolute | relative

if there are clearer terms than --at and --to, we should use those

we should also specify whether the symlink produces a relative path symlink (i.e., if you move the symlink, the referenced file will move too) or whether it produces an absolute path symlink (i.e., if you move the symlink, it'll still point to the same reference)

and require that the mode always be explicitly required
