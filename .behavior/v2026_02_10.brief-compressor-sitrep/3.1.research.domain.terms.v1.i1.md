## part 1: the two compression families — academic grounding

The system has two fundamentally different compression strategies that map precisely to established NLP terminology:

**llmlingua** = **extractive compression**. The output is a subsequence of the input. No new tokens are generated. LLMLingua-2 "formulates prompt compression as a token classification problem" [1] where each token is classified as keep/drop. "Output sequences are always subsequences of the source (extractive), ensuring faithfulness and preventing reordering or hallucination" [21]. This is analogous to abridgment in publishing: "an abridgment is made of selected quotations of a larger work; no new writing is composed" [8].

**bhrain/sitrep** = **abstractive compression**. The output is newly generated text. "Abstractive summarization generates original summaries using sentences not found in the original text documents" [3]. The brain reads the full source, comprehends its purpose, and writes a new, shorter version — like an "epitome, which is an original summation of a work" [8].

This extractive/abstractive split is the fundamental taxonomic axis in the NLP compression literature [2][3][23].

## part 2: domain object candidates

### object 1: the compression approach (left of @)

this is the HOW — the algorithm, strategy, or technique that determines how compression is performed. examples: `llmlingua/v2`, `bhrain/sitrep`.

| candidate | origin domain | etymology | pros | cons |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|------|------|
| **method** | general English | Middle English from Latin methodus, from Greek methodos "pursuit of knowledge, mode of inquiry" | universally understood; already used in the vision doc; neutral — does not over-promise | very generic; could mean anything; no compression-specific resonance |
| **technique** | craft/trade | French technique from Greek tekhnikos "of art, skillful" from tekhne "art, skill, craft" | implies learned skill/procedure; more specific than "method"; maps well to the idea of a compression craft | slightly longer; less commonly used as a noun in CLI conventions |
| **press** | blue collar / industrial | Latin pressare "to press, squeeze" — from industrial pressing, baling, forging [15] | visceral, physical metaphor for compression; short; verb and noun form both work ("press the brief", "which press?"); maps to printing press (publishing) too | could confuse with "press" as in journalism; slightly informal |
| **still** | distillation / chemistry | Old English stillan "to be still, be calm" — the distillation apparatus that separates essence from bulk [9][10] | beautiful metaphor — a still is the apparatus that performs distillation; maps to the concept of a method being the vessel/apparatus that performs the compression; the alembic is a specific kind of still | obscure for most developers; might confuse with the adjective "still" |
| **codec** | information theory | portmanteau of "coder-decoder" [17] | precisely describes encode/decode pipeline; well-known in media compression | implies lossless reversibility, which is not true here; overly technical |

**decision**: **press** — a visceral, domain-specific term. a "press" is the apparatus that compresses. `$press@$brain` reads well. "which press did you use?" is clear. dual-heritage: industrial press (compression) + print press (publication). short, works as both verb and noun.

**runner-up**: **method** — universally understood, maps to NLP literature's "compression method." deliberately generic, which is a feature. but "press" won out for its compression-specific resonance and brevity.

---

### object 2: the brain/model (right of @)

This is the engine — the model that executes the method. Examples: `tinybert`, `xai/grok/code-fast-1`.

| candidate | origin domain | etymology | pros | cons |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|------|------|
| **brain** | current project term (bhrain = Irish for brain) | Old English braegen, "brain" | already established in the codebase; maps to the "bhrain" prefix; clear metaphor — the brain does the thinking | slightly informal for academic contexts; but this is not academia |
| **model** | NLP / ML | Latin modellus "small measure, standard" | precise ML terminology; universally understood in AI context | too generic; "model" overloaded (data model, domain model, etc.); loses the visceral clarity of "brain" |
| **engine** | mechanical / industrial | Latin ingenium "inborn qualities, talent" then "a device, machine" | implies the thing that provides power/execution; clear separation from method | already overused in software ("search engine", "template engine", "rule engine") |
| **distiller** | chemistry / spirits | Latin destillare "to drip down" — the apparatus (alembic, retort) that performs distillation [9] | maps beautifully to bhrain/sitrep (semantic distillation); the distiller is the agent that reduces complex material to its essence | does not map well to llmlingua (which is extractive, not distillation); conflates agent with apparatus |

**decision**: **brain** — it is already the established term in the codebase (`bhrain` = brain in Irish), it is viscerally clear (the brain thinks, the press tells it how), and the `$press@$brain` convention reads naturally even to someone seeing it for the first time. for llmlingua, the "brain" is a tiny BERT model — still a neural network, still a brain, just a small one.

---

### object 3: the template/prompt pattern (e.g., "sitrep")

This guides the brain on HOW to compress — the instructions, the format, the lens through which the brain views the source document. Currently: "sitrep".

| candidate | origin domain | etymology | pros | cons |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|------|------|
| **template** | craft/construction | Latin templum "piece of timber, plank" — a pattern or mold used to shape output | universally understood; already used in the vision doc; precisely describes a prompt template | very generic; no compression-specific resonance |
| **lens** | optics / photography | Latin lens "lentil" (from the shape of a lentil seed resembling a lens) | elegant metaphor — the lens determines what you see and how you see it; a sitrep lens shows the brief through a military-brevity perspective | metaphor might be too abstract; "lens" in software often means "view" (e.g., VS Code lens) |
| **form** | military / bureaucracy | Latin forma "form, contour, figure, shape" | military reports have specific forms (DA Form 1594 for duty logs, etc.); a sitrep is a specific form; matches the military origin of "sitrep" | overloaded in software (HTML form, form factor, etc.) |
| **mold** | manufacturing / casting | Old English mold "earth, soil" then "a frame for shaping" | the mold shapes the output; different molds produce different shapes from the same material | slightly industrial; could imply rigidity that does not match LLM generation |
| **recipe** | culinary | Latin recipere "to receive, take" — originally "take (these ingredients)" | a recipe tells the cook (brain) how to transform ingredients (source) into a dish (output); maps to the culinary reduction metaphor | slightly informal; implies combining ingredients rather than reducing |

**decision**: **template** — it is the most precise and least ambiguous term. in the `bhrain/sitrep` convention, "sitrep" is already the template name — it names the specific prompt pattern. the word "template" describes the category: `bhrain/$template@$brain`. this maps to how the system actually works: the template is a prompt file that shapes the brain's compression behavior.

**runner-up**: **lens** — if you want a term that evokes the idea of "different ways of seeing the same document." A sitrep lens. A debrief lens. A precis lens. It is more evocative, but "template" is more precise.

---

### object 4: the source document

The brief being compressed. The input.

| candidate | origin domain | etymology | pros | cons |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|------|------|
| **source** | general / CS | Latin surgere "to rise, spring up" — the origin point | universally understood; standard in compiler/build terminology (source -> artifact); neutral | very generic |
| **brief** | military / legal | Latin brevis "short" — originally a summary of a case given to a lawyer; in military, a document that conveys instructions | already the established domain term for the documents being compressed; self-descriptive — briefs are by nature meant to be brief | already the project's primary noun; using it for both the category and the input could cause ambiguity |
| **stock** | culinary | Old English stocc "trunk, block, log" — in cooking, the base liquid from which reductions and glazes are made [12] | beautiful metaphor — stock is the rich base material that gets reduced into a glace (compressed output); "one gallon of stock producing only 1 to 2 cups of glaze" [12] maps directly to compression ratios | too domain-specific; would confuse anyone not thinking in culinary terms |
| **feed** | agriculture / data | Old English fedan "to nourish" — what you feed into a machine | short; implies input to a process; used in data pipelines ("data feed") | implies continuous stream, not a single document |

**decision**: **BriefOriginal** — the formal domain term for the source document. in the pipeline `BriefOriginal -> compress -> BriefMinified`, the domain objects are explicit. "source" remains valid as a casual reference to the brief's role in the compression pipeline.

**note on "brief"**: the documents to compress are already called briefs. in the context of the compression operation, the brief is the source. both terms are correct in different contexts: "brief" describes what the document is, "BriefOriginal" / "source" describes its role in the operation.

---

### object 5: the compressed output

The result of compression. Currently `.md.min`.

| candidate | origin domain | etymology | pros | cons |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|------|------|
| **min** (as in `.md.min`) | software / minification | abbreviation of "minified" — from web dev convention (`.min.js`, `.min.css`) | already established convention in the project; immediately recognizable to web developers; implies "same content, smaller" | ".min" in web dev means whitespace removal (lossless); brief compression is lossy — different semantics |
| **digest** | publishing / law / biology | Latin digestus "separated, arranged, dissolved" [5] — in Roman law, the Digest was a compilation of legal writings into essential form; in biology, to break down into absorbable components | rich etymology — "to carry apart" then "to arrange systematically"; a digest is a condensed, organized version of source material; `.md.digest` reads well | less familiar to developers than `.min`; could confuse with cryptographic digest (hash) |
| **precis** | publishing / French | Latin praecisus "cut off, abridged" from praecidere "to cut off, shorten" [6] | etymologically perfect — literally means "cut short"; a precis is a concise summary that preserves essential meaning; `.md.precis` is self-documenting | accent mark (precis vs precis) could cause filesystem issues; unfamiliar to many developers |
| **glace** | culinary | French glace "ice, glaze" — demi-glace means "half-glaze"; a glace is stock reduced to its most concentrated form [11][12] | evocative metaphor — "one gallon of stock producing only 1 to 2 cups of glaze" [12]; the compression ratio metaphor is exact | too obscure; would require explanation for every new team member |
| **distillate** | chemistry / spirits | Latin destillare "to drip down" — the purified output of distillation [10] | precisely describes the bhrain/sitrep output — the essential content distilled from the source; `.md.distillate` is self-documenting | too long for a file extension; does not describe the extractive (llmlingua) output well |
| **abridged** | publishing | Old French abregier "to shorten" from Latin abbreviare | precisely describes extractive compression — an abridged version retains original words [8]; maps to audiobook convention ("abridged edition") | too long for a file extension; `.md.abridged` is unwieldy |

**decision**: **`.min` suffix** with domain terms **`BriefOriginal`** (source) and **`BriefMinified`** (compressed output). the file suffix is `$ext.min` — appended to the source extension (e.g., `brief.md` → `brief.md.min`, `brief.txt.md` → `brief.txt.md.min`). the convention is already established, immediately recognizable, and short. the domain object terms `BriefOriginal` and `BriefMinified` provide the formal vocabulary for the pipeline.

**runner-up**: **digest** — if you ever want a term that more precisely describes what the compressed output is (an arranged, condensed version of the source material), `.md.digest` would be self-documenting. the Roman law origin is fitting: the Justinian Digest was a massive compression of centuries of legal texts into their essential rulings [5].

---

### object 6: the compression operation itself

The act of taking source -> compressed output. The verb.

| candidate | origin domain | etymology | pros | cons |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|------|------|
| **compress** | general / physics | Latin compressare "to press together" from com- "together" + pressare "to press" | already the established verb in the codebase; universally understood; the skill is `brief.compress` | very generic; does not distinguish extractive from abstractive |
| **reduce** | culinary / chemistry | Latin reducere "to lead back, bring back" — in cooking, to reduce is to concentrate by evaporation [11][12] | maps to both methods: llmlingua reduces token count, bhrain reduces content to essentials; culinary "reduction" is the perfect metaphor for lossy compression that concentrates flavor/meaning | could confuse with functional programming `.reduce()`; slightly overloaded |
| **distill** | chemistry / spirits | Latin destillare "to drip down" — to purify by evaporation and condensation [9] | beautiful metaphor for the bhrain method specifically — the brain distills the essential meaning from the source; "semantic distillation" is already used in the vision doc | does not describe the extractive (llmlingua) method well; llmlingua does not distill, it prunes |
| **abridge** | publishing | Old French abregier "to shorten" from Latin abbreviare | precisely describes extractive compression [8]; implies shortening while retaining completeness | does not describe the abstractive (bhrain) method well; too publishing-specific |
| **press** | industrial / printing | Latin pressare "to press, squeeze" | short; works as verb ("press the brief") and noun ("which press?"); maps to both printing press and industrial compaction | less established than "compress"; slightly informal |

**decision**: **compress** — it is already the established verb, the skill is named `brief.compress`, and it is the umbrella term that covers both extractive and abstractive approaches. "compress" is the genus; extractive and abstractive are the species. no reason to change it.

**runner-up**: **reduce** — if you ever want to use a culinary-inspired term for the operation. "reduce the brief" evokes the kitchen metaphor of concentrating flavor by removing water/volume. the problem is `.reduce()` in JavaScript.

### the `$press@$brain` convention decomposed

│      │      │

│         │  │
│         │  └── brain: tinybert
│         └── version: v2
└── family: llmlingua
```

### key relationships

1. **press contains template** (for bhrain family): `bhrain/sitrep` means "use the bhrain family with the sitrep template." the template is a component of the press, not a separate top-level object. this is correct — the template only makes sense in the context of a brain-based press.

2. **press + brain = full via spec**: the `$press@$brain` string is the complete specification for a compression operation. this is analogous to:
   - npm: `package@version`
   - docker: `image@digest`
   - email: `user@host`
   - the `@` always means "this specific thing AT this specific provider/context"

3. **source -> operation -> output pipeline**:
   ```
   source.md ──[compress --via $press@$brain]──> source.md.min
   ```
   the operation is a pure function: given (source, press, brain), produce output. this is the same pattern as a compiler: `source.ts -> [tsc] -> source.js`.

4. **extractive vs abstractive is a property of the press family, not a separate object**:
   - `llmlingua/*` presses are always extractive [1][21]
   - `bhrain/*` presses are always abstractive [3]
   - this distinction lives in the press family, not in a separate "mode" or "type" flag

---

## part 4: cross-domain metaphor analysis

### distillation (chemistry/spirits)

The distillation metaphor is the richest parallel for the bhrain/sitrep method:

- **source** = the crude mixture (mash, fermented liquid) = the full brief
- **still/alembic** = the apparatus that performs distillation [9][10] = the method
- **heat** = the energy applied = the brain's inference compute
- **distillate** = the purified output = the compressed brief
- **heads/hearts/tails** = fractions of the distillate with different quality = different compression ratios capturing different amounts of the "essential" content

The alembic metaphor is particularly apt: "The apparatus consisted essentially of three parts: a gourdlike vessel containing the material to be distilled, called the cucurbit; a vessel to receive and condense the vapour, called the alembic proper; and a receiver for the distillate" [10]. in our system: the cucurbit is the source brief (BriefOriginal), the alembic is the press+brain, and the receiver holds the BriefMinified ($path.min).

**verdict**: beautiful but too obscure for a developer-facing CLI. Best used in documentation/mental models, not in code identifiers.

### culinary reduction

The culinary metaphor works for both methods:

- **stock** = the base liquid = the full brief [12]
- **reduction** = the process of concentrating by removing water = compression
- **demi-glace** = stock reduced by half = a moderately compressed brief [11]
- **glace** = stock reduced to a thick syrup, "one gallon producing only 1 to 2 cups" [12] = an aggressively compressed brief

The ratio metaphor is exact: a 4x compression is like reducing 4 cups of stock to 1 cup of glace. The flavor (meaning) is concentrated, not diluted.

**verdict**: useful for documentation and mental models. "Reduction" as a verb competes with `.reduce()` in JavaScript. Not suitable for code identifiers.

### cartography

- **generalization** = "selection, simplification, and symbolization of detail according to the purpose and scale of the map" [13]
- **simplification** = "determining and retaining the essential characteristics of the data while excluding unnecessary details" [14]

The cartographic generalization metaphor maps to brief compression: you are producing a lower-detail representation of the same territory, optimized for a different scale (token budget). The key insight from cartography is that "the level of generalisation implies simplification and detailing, where a low level of generalisation signifies a high information density" [13] — this maps to compression ratio.

**verdict**: "simplification" is too vague and implies the source was unnecessarily complex. "Generalization" is precise but jargon-heavy. Best as conceptual backdrop.

### military briefing

- **sitrep** = situation report — "concise, formatted reports providing current tactical situation snapshots" [20]
- **frago** = fragmentary order — an amendment to an extant order, designed to communicate urgent changes without re-issuing the full order
- **brevity codes** = "standardized procedure words used to efficiently communicate complex information through concise, easily understood terms" [19]
- **opord** = operations order — the full, detailed order from which sitreps and fragos are derived

The sitrep metaphor is precise for the bhrain compression template: the brain reads the full brief (opord) and produces a sitrep — a concise, formatted report that preserves only what is decision-critical. The military domain's obsession with brevity while maintaining actionability is exactly what brief compression aims for.

**verdict**: "sitrep" is the right name for the first template. It is self-documenting for anyone who knows what a sitrep is, and easily explained ("situation report — the military format for writing concise, actionable summaries") for anyone who does not.

### industrial / blue collar

- **baling** = "compressing materials into tightly bound, manageable blocks known as bales" [15]
- **pressing** = applying gradual controlled pressure to shape material
- **forging** = using slow pressure to reshape material

The industrial metaphor is visceral: compression is physical force reducing volume. The "press" metaphor is the most transferable: a press takes input material and produces a denser output. The printing press connection is a bonus — the printing press also transforms manuscripts into published form.

**verdict**: "press" was chosen as the term for the compression approach (`$press@$brain`). it is short, visceral, and dual-heritage (industrial + publication).

### publishing / editing

- **abridgment** = "reduction in compass with retention of relative completeness... made of selected quotations" [8] — maps to extractive compression
- **epitome** = "an original summation of a work" [8] — maps to abstractive compression
- **digest** = "to separate, divide, arrange" [5] — a condensed, organized version
- **precis** = "cut short, condensed" [6] — etymologically "cut off"

The publishing domain provides the clearest parallel to the extractive/abstractive split: abridgment (extractive) vs epitome (abstractive). The word "digest" bridges both — it implies systematic condensation regardless of method.

**verdict**: "digest" is the strongest candidate for the output artifact if `.md.min` ever needs replacement. "Precis" is etymologically perfect but has the accent-mark problem.

## part 5: decided ubiquitous language

| domain object | decided term | alternatives considered | rationale |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|-----------|
| compression approach (left of @) | **press** | method, technique, still, codec | visceral, compression-specific; dual-heritage industrial + publication; short; `$press@$brain` reads naturally |
| brain/model (right of @) | **brain** | model, engine, distiller | already established in codebase (bhrain); clear metaphor; works for both tiny BERT and large LLMs |
| template/prompt pattern | **template** | lens, form, mold, recipe | precisely describes what it is (a prompt template); "sitrep" is a template name |
| source document | **BriefOriginal** | source, brief, stock, feed | formal domain term for the input document before compression |
| compressed output | **BriefMinified** / `$path.min` | .md.digest, .md.precis, .md.glace | domain term + file suffix; `$ext.min` convention is established, recognizable, short |
| compression operation | **compress** | reduce, distill, abridge, press | already the skill name; umbrella verb for both presses |
| full via spec | **--via** | --mech, --compressor, --spec | "compress via bhrain/sitrep@grok" reads as natural English; names the full `$press@$brain` spec |

### the convention reads as

```
compress source.md --via $press@$brain
                        │       │
                        │       └── brain: which model executes
                        └── press: how to compress
                             ├── family: llmlingua | bhrain
                             └── template: (bhrain only) sitrep, debrief, etc.
```

### why "--via" works for the full spec

"via" means "by way of" — from Latin via "road, path." `--via bhrain/sitrep@xai/grok/code-fast-1` reads as natural English: "compress this brief via bhrain/sitrep at grok/code-fast-1." it names the route, the method of travel — which press, which brain. no jargon, no ambiguity.

---

## part 6: open questions for the caller

1. ~~**Should "mech" remain the flag name for the full `$method@$brain` spec?**~~ **resolved**: `--via` is the flag. `$press@$brain` is the convention. "compress via bhrain/sitrep@grok/code-fast-1" reads as natural English.

2. ~~**Should the output extension vary by press family?**~~ **resolved**: single `.min` suffix for both presses. same interface, same extension, maximum interchangeability. domain terms: `BriefOriginal` (source) and `BriefMinified` (compressed output).

3. **Should "template" be a first-class domain object with its own directory?** currently the sitrep template is embedded in the bhrain compression code. if more templates are expected (debrief, precis, opord), they might benefit from a `templates/` directory structure.

4. **Is "family" (llmlingua vs bhrain) a term that needs to be surfaced to users?** currently it is implicit in the press string. if users need to filter or select by family, it might need to be a first-class concept.
