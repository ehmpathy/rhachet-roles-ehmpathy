we've got a compressor skill for the mechanic now

it uses mech llmlingua/v2/*

---

well, we'd like to rename that compress.ts file to compress.via.llmlingua.ts 

and create a new compressor which leverages the grok brain & a custom prompt


for example

compress --mech bhrain/sitrep/$bhrain-choice


e.g., 

compress --mech bhrain/sitrep/grok/code-fast-1

which would invoke a code-fast-1 llm to use the sitrep prompt to compress the target

---

we should be able to invoke that brain directly in a compress.via.bhrain.ts file next to compress.via.llmlingua.ts

and we should use the `genContextBrainChoice` adapter from `rhachet` to do so (similar to how we did the guardBorder implementation, but without needing to create domain.operations due to the simplicity of the task)

---

fundamentally,

we want to be able to experiment with different

bhrian/$template/$brain 

variants of compression


where the first template we want to launch with is the "sitrep" template (websearch on this)

which should inform the brain to distill the document into the most absolutely nessesary parts to achieve the objective it was designed for


as usual, input = $path, output=$path.min (unless specified otherwise via an --into flag, which should be supported by both compressors)
