based on what was found in .behavior/v2026_02_11.brief-compressor-evals/6.nextsteps.condensor-and-kernelizer.md

the cornerstone of our compression capacity depends on kernelization

therefore,

1. we need a dedicated skill just for that operation
2. we need a dedicated suite of evals for it too


see .behavior/v2026_02_11.brief-compressor-evals/6.nextsteps.condensor-and-kernelizer.md
