wish =

that we didn't have to have a human in the loop to approve websearch or webfetch

question is

1. is it safe, given the permission lockdown we currently have via that .jsonc, to allow mechanic's by default to search the web and fetch any resource they want?
2. if its not safe, could we leverage the rhachet BrainAtom contract to have an isolated brain that inspects the content of every webfetch and blocks any security risk contents from reaching the agent?

i.e., puts that content in a .malicious / .hazardous dir (w/ a .gitignore on it) for human inspection but has a deny on reads to that dir for the agents && tells the agent (this content has been flagged as malicious and so is not acceptable) 

honestly, ideally we can always do that second option really

with some kind of post tooluse hook that operates only after the fetch completes but before the brain gets the content 

---

then, we could safely allowlist all websearches by default

and we can use a cheap brain.atom like rhachet-brains-xai 's grok-code-fast-1 to do the review easily, too

and since its already a network fetch w/ latency, there's not even a concern on the added latency to review it
