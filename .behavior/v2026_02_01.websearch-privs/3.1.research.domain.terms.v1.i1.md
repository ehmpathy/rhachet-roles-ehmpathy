# research: domain terms for websearch.border.guard

## parallel domains for terminology

### border security / customs

the vision already uses the "border guard" metaphor. this domain provides:

- **inspector** — the agent who examines content
- **inspection** — the act of examine
- **admit / deny** — the binary decision
- **quarantine** — isolation of suspect items
- **interception** — the capture of prohibited content

> "Travelers determined by the CBP officer to be admissible are allowed to enter the United States, though they may be subject to a separate customs and/or agricultural inspection."

> "Quarantine Materials Interceptions (QMI) are the agricultural items that were regulated and intercepted by CBP agriculture specialists resulting from an inspection."

### healthcare / epidemiology

quarantine is deeply rooted in disease control:

- **quarantine** — isolation to prevent spread (40 days, from Italian "quaranta giorni")
- **screening** — initial check before deeper examination
- **isolation** — separation of confirmed cases
- **containment** — prevent escape/spread

> "The most common category of biosecurity policies are quarantine measures adopted to counteract the spread of disease."

### mail / postal

letters and packages go through inspection:

- **inspection** — content examination
- **return to sender** — rejected content
- **held for inspection** — quarantine equivalent
- **delivered** — allowed through

## term proposals

### for the border guard component

| option | pros | cons |
|--------|------|------|
| `borderGuard` | matches vision metaphor, clear action | slightly long |
| `inspector` | standard term, clear role | generic, less specific |
| `gatekeeper` | common software term | less specific about inspection |
| `screener` | healthcare parallel | less common in software |

**recommendation**: `borderGuard` — already established in the vision, clear metaphor

### for the inspection decision

| option | pros | cons |
|--------|------|------|
| `allow / block` | standard software terms | generic |
| `admit / deny` | border metaphor, official | less common in software |
| `pass / fail` | test metaphor | implies quality not safety |
| `clear / quarantine` | healthcare parallel | mixes metaphors |

**recommendation**: `allow / block` — industry standard for guardrails, clear intent

### for the quarantine location

| option | pros | cons |
|--------|------|------|
| `.quarantine/` | standard term, clear metaphor, self-document | none |
| `.blocked/` | direct, simple | less descriptive |
| `.intercepted/` | border metaphor | less common |

**recommendation**: `.quarantine/` — standard term, clear metaphor

### for the url pre-check

| option | pros | cons |
|--------|------|------|
| `isUrlAdmissible` | border metaphor, predicate form | none |
| `urlValidator` | standard pattern | generic, not a predicate |
| `urlGate` | short, clear metaphor | slightly vague |
| `originChecker` | security term | less intuitive |

**recommendation**: `isUrlAdmissible` — border metaphor (admissible = allowed entry), predicate form

---

## proposed ubiquitous language

| term | definition |
|------|------------|
| borderGuard | the component that inspects fetched content for safety |
| isUrlAdmissible | predicate that checks if a url is allowed for fetch (not localhost, not private ip) |
| quarantine | the isolated storage for blocked content |
| .quarantine/ | the filesystem directory for quarantined content |
| allow | decision to pass content to the agent |
| block | decision to deny content to the agent |
| inspect | the act of the border guard to examine content |

---

## alignment check

all terms:
- avoid jargon — standard industry terms or clear metaphors
- avoid overload — each term has one sense
- avoid ambiguity — terms are specific to their role
- follow noun.adj pattern where applicable

the border/customs metaphor is consistent throughout — content "enters" the agent's context, border guard "inspects", blocked content is "quarantined".
