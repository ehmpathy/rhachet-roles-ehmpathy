wish to create an evals framework to evaluate the performance of different compressor options for the bhrain/sitrep compressor

e.g., a

in perfevals, lets make it possible to supply different briefs and see how the performance varries over average of   
                                                                                                                              
     3 runs with different briefs and prompts        
                                                         
                                                                                                                              
❯ we want to experiment to find which set of briefs will produce the best compression rate                                    
                                                                                                                              
❯ also, we want to operate on a FEW different types of briefs from the mechanic role to get an average across a               
  representatiev sample                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                              
❯ also, those compressions should run in parallel (parallel brain calls)

❯ ok, now we want to compare the perfevals of [sitrep, tsc], [sitrep], [tsc, sitrep], [sitrep, tsc, sitrep] ; each            
  combination of briefs - since they may produce different results     

                                   
❯ also, report how long those tests take to run                                                                               
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                              
  yeah, not chained compression passes; i mean to modify the briefs passed to the role
