# notes: brief compressor evals

## next skill: condense

the next skill to build is `condense` — a higher-level operation that:
- calls `compress` internally (just like evals do)
- optimizes for **densification**, not just compression
- goal: maximize semantic density (kernels / tokens)

### name rationale

| term | definition |
|------|------------|
| `compress` | reduce token count (the mechanism) |
| `condense` | increase semantic density (the goal) |

compress is the tool. condense is the intent.

### metrics priority

when we evaluate condense performance, metrics should be ordered by importance:

**primary (deltas with stddev):**
1. `dens.Δ` — density gain (higher = better)
2. `kern.Δ` — kernel retention (closer to 0 = better, negative = lost signal)
3. `tok.Δ` — token reduction (more negative = better)

**secondary (absolute values):**
4. `dens.src`, `dens.min` — source and minified density
5. `kern.src`, `kern.min` — source and minified kernel count
6. `tok.src`, `tok.min` — source and minified token count

### core principle

> **kernels retain, density rises**

good condensation keeps the kernels (signal) while it removes tokens (noise).
- tokens drop (noise removed)
- kernels stay (signal preserved)
- density rises (more signal per token)
