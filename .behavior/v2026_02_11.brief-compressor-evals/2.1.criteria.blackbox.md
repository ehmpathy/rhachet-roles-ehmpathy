# blackbox criteria: brief compressor evals

## usecase.1 = compare methodology brief combinations

```
given('methodology brief combinations to compare')

    then('each combination is tested against the same sample briefs')

## usecase.2 = validate specific combinations

```

## usecase.3 = representative sample coverage

```

## usecase.5 = duration metrics

```

  when('duration is reported')
    then('total wall-clock time is shown')
    then('average time per compression is calculable')
