❯ ❯ also, are we able to test a [sitrep-aggro-aware] vsersion which is both aggressive and taskaware?                         
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                              
      on its own and as part of the [[kernelize], [sitrep-*], [tsc]] chain?            

i dont see either of those in the perf eval reports

    ❯ also, lets expand the term tsc to telegraphic, to eliminate acronyms for readability                                    
                                                                                                                              
    ❯ also, where can i see the stats files that these tests produce? are tehy all writing to

  also, have you updated .behavior/v2026_02_11.brief-compressor-evals/5.proposal.adaptive-compression.md with your latest

  also, where is the emitted report doc on tokens/kernel density effect on compression?                                       
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                              
  most importantly, where are the raw perfeal logs so we can discuss the outputs? that perfeval needs to persist the          
  outputs.

  figure out how to use with-simple-cache and simple-on-disk-cache withSimpleOnDiskCache to eliminate the performance issues; you can thread through an 'attempt' index to ensure each distinct attempt gets distinct outcomes

  but we want to cache the results based on the hash of the propmpt and inputs used


  so that when we re-run the  perf-evals, if nothing has changed for prior combos, then we'll just get the cached data automatically, and not have to wait forever
