 that kernel retention is unacceptable though. are the subsequent steps both given knowledge of the kernels?                 
                                                                                                                              
  also, is kernelize used to SUPPLEMENT the context of the subsequent steps? (i.e., a prethought stage) or is it used to      
  MUTATE the content of the subsequent stpes (i.e. is a compressor itself)?                                                   
                                                                                                                              
  lets evaluate the option where kernelize is a SUPPLEMENT rather than a COMPRESSOR ; e.g., sup[kernelize],
