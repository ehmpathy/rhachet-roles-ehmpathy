# self-review: all-simple-junior

## question
are there any parts that are needlessly over complicated? any opportunities to simplify yet still fulfill the full vision and criteria?

## simplifications made

1. **removed 4 new skills**
   - junior proposed keyrack.init, keyrack.unlock, keyrack.set, keyrack.get
   - rhachet already implements these
   - **simplified**: just use rhachet keyrack get

2. **removed implementation sections**
   - host manifest location
   - session lock mechanism
   - keyrack.yml schema
   - **simplified**: rhachet handles all of this

3. **removed test files for keyrack skills**
   - junior proposed 4 integration test files
   - rhachet tests its own keyrack implementation
   - **simplified**: no new test files needed

## final scope

| before | after |
|--------|-------|
| 4 new skills | 0 new skills |
| 4 test files | 0 test files |
| 2 file changes | 2 file changes |

the blueprint is now minimal: update keyrack.yml, update git.commit.push.sh.
