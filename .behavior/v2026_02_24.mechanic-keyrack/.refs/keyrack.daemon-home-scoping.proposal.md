# proposal: keyrack daemon home-scoped caching

## primary use case: integration tests

integration tests need isolated keyrack state per test. each test uses a temp HOME directory to isolate filesystem state (manifests, vaults, ssh keys). but the keyrack daemon ignores the test's HOME and returns stale state from previous runs.

this makes it impossible to reliably test keyrack operations like:
- first run should show "configure..." (key not found, stdin consumed)
- second run should show "configured ✓" (key found, no prompt)

the daemon's stale cache causes the first run to show "configured ✓" even when the manifest was just created.

## problem

the keyrack daemon caches state by owner name only. this means:
- `keyrack unlock --owner ehmpath` at `HOME=/home/vlad` → cache slot "ehmpath"
- `keyrack unlock --owner ehmpath` at `HOME=/tmp/test` → same cache slot "ehmpath"

tests that use isolated HOME directories can't get isolated daemon state. the daemon ignores the HOME of each CLI request and uses stale state from previous runs.

## proposal

key daemon cache by `(owner, home_hash)` instead of just `owner`.

```
cache_key = f"{owner}:{hash(home_path)[:8]}"
```

example:
- `owner=ehmpath` at `HOME=/home/vlad` → cache key `ehmpath:a1b2c3d4`
- `owner=ehmpath` at `HOME=/tmp/test-xyz` → cache key `ehmpath:e5f6g7h8`

## behavior change

### before
```
CLI: keyrack unlock --owner ehmpath  [HOME=/tmp/test]
     ↓
Daemon: lookup cache["ehmpath"]  ← stale state from /home/vlad
```

### after
```
CLI: keyrack unlock --owner ehmpath  [HOME=/tmp/test]
     ↓
     (passes HOME path to daemon)
     ↓
Daemon: lookup cache["ehmpath:e5f6g7h8"]  ← fresh state for /tmp/test
```

## implementation notes

1. CLI passes `HOME` (or resolved manifest base path) in each request to daemon
2. daemon hashes the path and combines with owner for cache key
3. manifest lookups use the passed HOME, not daemon's own HOME
4. relock/unlock operate on the home-scoped cache slot

## benefits

- tests naturally isolated: just set `HOME=tempDir`
- no changes to CLI interface (HOME already in env)
- backwards compatible: extant usage unchanged
- deterministic: same HOME always hits same cache slot

## alternative considered

**stateless mode**: `--no-daemon` flag that bypasses daemon entirely

- pro: simpler, no daemon changes
- con: slower (no caching), requires prikey for every operation
- verdict: could be useful for simple scripts, but doesn't solve the core isolation problem

## acceptance criteria

given a keyrack daemon is running
  when `keyrack unlock --owner X` is called with `HOME=/path/a`
    then the daemon caches state under key `X:hash(/path/a)`
  when `keyrack unlock --owner X` is called with `HOME=/path/b`
    then the daemon caches state under key `X:hash(/path/b)`
    then the two cache slots are independent
