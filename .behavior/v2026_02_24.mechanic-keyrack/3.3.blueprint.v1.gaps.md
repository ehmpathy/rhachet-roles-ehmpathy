# gap analysis: blueprint vs criteria

## scope clarification

the wish asks to use keyrack in git.commit.push.sh — not to implement keyrack itself.

rhachet implements keyrack. this behavior just integrates it.

## criteria coverage

| criteria | covered by |
|----------|------------|
| skill fetches key invisibly | git.commit.push.sh calls keyrack get |
| fail-fast errors guide mechanic | rhachet keyrack get handles this |

## gaps

none — simplified blueprint covers the wish.
