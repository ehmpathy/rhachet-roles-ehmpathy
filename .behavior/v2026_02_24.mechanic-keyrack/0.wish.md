lets take the .plans/keyrack.contract.md file and move it into this behavior's .refs/ dir

then, take a look at the contents

lets implement those

we want the `git.commit.push` operation to extract the cred from the keyrack automatically 

so that we never hear a clone say "i dnot have the auth to do this, you'll have to do it yourself" ever again

after all, ask not what your clone can do for you

and instead, give them better tools
