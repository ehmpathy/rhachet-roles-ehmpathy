# self-review: all-done-junior

## question
a junior recently worked on this blueprint. review against the criteria and vision and flag any gaps detected.

## junior mistakes found

1. **over-scoped the work**
   - junior tried to blueprint the entire keyrack system
   - wish only asks to USE keyrack in git.commit.push.sh
   - rhachet implements keyrack — junior doesn't need to know how
   - **fixed**: simplified blueprint to just the integration

2. **specified implementation details**
   - host manifest location, session lock mechanism, keyrack.yml schema
   - these are rhachet's concerns, not the blueprint's
   - **fixed**: removed all implementation details

## gaps vs criteria

| criteria | junior covered? |
|----------|----------------|
| skill fetches key invisibly | ✓ (git.commit.push.sh calls keyrack get) |
| fail-fast errors guide mechanic | ✓ (rhachet handles this) |

## gaps vs vision

| vision | junior covered? |
|--------|----------------|
| invisible to mechanic | ✓ |
| portable | ✓ (keyrack handles) |
| fail-fast | ✓ (keyrack handles) |

## conclusion

junior over-engineered. fixed by narrowed scope to match the wish.
