wish =

we had a skill to enable git.commit for mechanics

it should use the predefined mechanic ehmpathy-turtle username and email to make the commit under

and it should simply give co-authorship to the parent git user 


that way, its clear that the ehmpathy-turtle is the user that created the commit

while it still attributes the human user that delegated the action with credit, like a sponsor

---

git.email = seaturtle@ehmpathy.com

git.name = Seaturtle Robot


---

also, we want to control the ability of the robot to use this tool


for example

- allow one commit
- allow two commits

or 

- allow all -> then deny all 


===

that way, we can chain orchestrations like 

git release --watch || (rhx show.gh.build.errors && git.commit.allow --uses 1) 


so that when it runs `git release --watch || rhx show.gh.build.errors`, it knows that it'll have atleast one commit to use

to allow it to commit once

so then when it runs

git.commit.set --message "asdfasdfasdf" , it'll work

---

we should also be able to prescribe 

git.commit.allow --uses N --with push 


so that it can run

git.commit.set --push --message "xyz" 


---

which under the hood, will push for it safely

that way, if it sees an error and fixes it, it can actually trigger the next push, and then watch it again

---

and on commit permission rejected, it should be told explicitly

you have now allowed uses of commits left. ask your human to allow 

---

also, on each set, it should tell it how many uses it has left 

and it should be allowed to `git.commit.uses get` to see how many uses are left 


and actually, the humans command shuld be `git.commit.uses set --allow 5 --push allow|block` 

where they should always be required to specify if push is allowed (so they dont forget)

---

state should be tracked in `.meter/` directory

- bootstrap `.meter/` with a `.gitignore` (ignore state files, keep readme)
- bootstrap `.meter/` with a `.readme` explaining why it exists
- update permissions denylist to deny bot write access to `.meter/*`

that way the mechanic can read its quota but cannot grant itself more
