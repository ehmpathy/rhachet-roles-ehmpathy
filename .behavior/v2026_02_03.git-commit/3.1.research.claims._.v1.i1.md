# Research Claims: Git Commit Skill

## Git Author vs Committer

### [1] [FACT] Git stores two distinct identities per commit
> "The author is the person who originally wrote the work, whereas the committer is the person who last applied the work."
- Source: [Git Author vs. Committer](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/git-author-vs-committer-whats-the-difference-57428d2ae644)

### [2] [FACT] Author and committer diverge during rebase, amend, cherry-pick, and patch application
> "When you perform a rebase operation... the author and author date remain unchanged, while the committer and commit date are updated to reflect the person who performed the rebase."
- Source: [Git Author vs. Committer](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/git-author-vs-committer-whats-the-difference-57428d2ae644)

### [3] [FACT] Pull requests preserve original author while maintainer becomes committer
> "This situation likely occurred because someone submitted a pull request, which was then accepted and committed by the repository owner... the author of the patch still receives credit for their work, even if they do not have commit access."

## Co-authored-by Trailer Format

### [4] [FACT] GitHub requires specific trailer format
> "The format for Co-authored-by trailers is: `Co-authored-by: name <name@example.com>`"
- Source: [GitHub Docs - Creating a commit with multiple authors](https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors)

### [5] [FACT] Trailers must be at the very end of commit message
> "GitHub requires that the `Co-authored-by` lines are AT THE VERY END of a commit, hence nothing must come after this."
- Source: [Git Trailers - Alchemists](https://alchemists.io/articles/git_trailers)

### [6] [FACT] Blank line required before trailers
> "Ensure there is a blank line (two consecutive newlines) between the end of your commit description and the Co-authored-by: commit trailer."
- Source: [GitHub Docs - Creating a commit with multiple authors](https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors)

### [7] [FACT] Email must match GitHub account for contribution credit
> "For the co-author's commit to count as a contribution, you must use the email associated with their account on GitHub.com."
- Source: [GitHub Docs - Creating a commit with multiple authors](https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors)

### [8] [FACT] Multiple co-authors each get their own line, no blank lines between
> "If you're adding multiple co-authors, give each co-author their own line and Co-authored-by: commit trailer. Do not add blank lines between each co-author line."
- Source: [GitHub Docs - Creating a commit with multiple authors](https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors)

## Bot Attribution Patterns

### [9] [FACT] GitHub has a special bot user format for actions
> "There is a special GitHub user account... using the configuration: `git config user.name github-actions[bot]` and `git config user.email 41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com`"
- Source: [Robo-committer for automated commits](https://dev.to/davorg/robo-committer-for-automated-commits-2kba)

### [10] [FACT] The [bot] suffix is a recognized GitHub convention
> "The GitHub Actions Bot has its own Octocat avatar that appears in the commits."
- Source: [Robo-committer for automated commits](https://dev.to/davorg/robo-committer-for-automated-commits-2kba)

### [11] [SUMP] Bot accounts should be separate from personal accounts
> "If you're working in an organisation and don't want to create a Personal Access Token from your personal account, it's recommended to use a bot-account for such tokens."

## AI Attribution Practices

### [12] [FACT] AI tools vary widely in attribution approach
> "Aider... adds '(aider)' to the author name and includes the model used as a co-author. GitHub Copilot doesn't add any automatic attribution."
- Source: [Copilots - Engineering Fundamentals Playbook](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/developer-experience/copilots/)

### [13] [FACT] GitHub Coding Agent uses bot-as-author, human-as-co-author pattern
> "The GitHub Coding Agent creates its commits using the agent as an author with the supervising person acknowledged using the Co-authored-by trailer in the commit message."
- Source: [Copilots - Engineering Fundamentals Playbook](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/developer-experience/copilots/)

### [14] [FACT] Claude attribution rates are much higher than Copilot
> "Results reveal widespread AI usage (95.2% of commits) but strategic attribution: only 29.5% employ explicit disclosure, with dramatic tool variation (Claude 80.5% versus Copilot 9.0%)."
- Source: [The AI Attribution Paradox](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.00867v1)

### [15] [OPIN] AI should be viewed as a tool, not a collaborator
> "Some argue that AI should be viewed as a tool, not a collaborator. The analogy often used: 'When we build a house, we don't credit the hammer and saw as co-authors.'"
- Source: [Should AI Be Listed as a Co-Author in Your Git Commits?](https://www.dariuszparys.com/should-ai-be-listed-as-a-co-author-in-your-git-commits/)

### [16] [OPIN] Attribution matters for substantial AI contributions
> "Attribution matters for substantial contributions - when AI writes complete functions, implements entire features, or generates the bulk of a commit."
- Source: [Should AI Be Listed as a Co-Author in Your Git Commits?](https://www.dariuszparys.com/should-ai-be-listed-as-a-co-author-in-your-git-commits/)

### [17] [OPIN] Attribution serves as traceability metadata
> "That little tag can act as a signal flare: 'Yes, I used AI here.' In research, regulatory settings, or for reproducibility, it can be helpful to document where AI assisted. Attribution becomes metadata—sometimes it's about traceability."
- Source: [Should AI Be Listed as a Co-Author in Your Git Commits?](https://www.dariuszparys.com/should-ai-be-listed-as-a-co-author-in-your-git-commits/)

### [18] [OPIN] Users should control what appears in their commits
> "The user should have complete control over what appears in their commit messages. Many users work in professional environments where automatic tool attribution in version control is inappropriate or unwanted."

## Open Questions

### [19] [KHUE] What is the legal status of AI-authored code?
> "This is a complex legal area that's still evolving. Generally, copyright for AI-assisted code depends on the level of human creative input and direction."

### [20] [KHUE] Does Co-authored-by transfer any rights?
> "The co-authored-by attribution doesn't transfer any copyright to Claude or Anthropic—it's purely informational."
- Source: [How to Use Git with Claude Code](https://www.deployhq.com/blog/how-to-use-git-with-claude-code-understanding-the-co-authored-by-attribution)

### [21] [KHUE] Who is responsible when AI writes the code?
