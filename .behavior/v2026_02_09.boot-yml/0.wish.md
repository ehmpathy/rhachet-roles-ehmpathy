rhachet recently released support for boot.yml 's on roles

we want to use these boot ymls to 

1. breakout the different subjects that could be booted from the mechanic role
	- always
	- subject.test
	- subject.prod
	- subject.arch
 	- etc

2. breakout the briefs that should be booted via --say vs booted via --ref 
	- which briefs should only be --ref'ed? (i.e., a link reference is sufficient)
	- which breifs surely must be --say'ed? (i.e., a full injection is important) 


---

lets start with a proposal of which breifs get clustered across which subjects (overlap is fine, btw)

and which ones should be refed or sayed
