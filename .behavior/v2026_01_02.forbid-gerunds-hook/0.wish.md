wish =

add a pretooluse hook to the mechanic (follow current pattern)

which blocks via hardnudge pattern any attempts to write files with gerunds

block
- writes
- edits

any words with -ing suffix are suspect

hardnudge so that if the mechanic attempts to do so twice in a row on the same file for the same gerund within 5 min, it'll allow it (e.g., if its a term like `string`)

also, track an allowlist of allowable gerunds

---

the goal is to eliminate gerunds by default

they degrade the quality of though massively

and it takes a ton of tokes to retroactively eliminate them
