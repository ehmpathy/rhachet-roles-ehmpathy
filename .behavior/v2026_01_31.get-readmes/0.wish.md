wish =

to have a mechanic skill, called `get.readme`

so that we could

npx rhachet run --skill get.package.docs readme --of $package

e.g., 

rhx get.package.docs readme --of iso-price
rhx get.package.docs readme --of test-fns

etc

to make it easy for actors to fetch readmes of any package

and incentivize them to do so.

we should also have a workflow rule that says that before use of any package, we check the readme for how to use it.

--

too often, packages aren't used correctly and boilerplate code is added when it could have all been resolved if we just read the docs

---

specifically, we want to support readme sources in this priority order

1. node_modules; see if the distributed node module has the readme.md bundled with it
2. npm; grab the readme from npm via the api, for the specific version of the package

if not from any of them, then just tell them could not find repo; run `npx rhachet run --skill get.package.docs tree --of $pacakge` to get the tree, instead

---

so, ultimately, we want to externalize one skill with two suboperations

1. rhx get.package.docs readme --of $package
2. rhx get.package.docs filetree --of $package 

that way, our mechanics can eaisly get the readmes and the filetrees of any package they want to use

and along with that flow.prod rule, should remember to do so too

---

recall: rhx = an alias to `rhachet run --skill`
