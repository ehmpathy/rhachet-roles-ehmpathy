wish =

we wish to create a skill leverage the LLMLingua approach discovered via .research/v2025_02_09.brief-minification and declared in .research/v2025_02_09.brief-minification/7.ejection.distill-later-via-librarian.md 

specifically, we want to create a skill under the mechanic role for now to compress briefs

then use it to compress the mechanics briefs into `.md.min` files, collocated next to the original files

first, we should understand what LLMLingua is and how we can use it (v2 version?)

then, we should create a skill which is capable of being ran against any .md file and generates a .md.min file

we'll call that skill

brief.compress 

so that we can run it with

rhx brief.compress 

--

e.g.,

rhx brief.compress $path.to.brief.md
