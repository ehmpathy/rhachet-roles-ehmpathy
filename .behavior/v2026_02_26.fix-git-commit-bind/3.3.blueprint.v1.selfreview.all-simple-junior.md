# self-review: 3.3.blueprint.v1 — all-simple-junior

## simplicity review

reviewed the blueprint for unnecessary complexity. looked for opportunities to simplify.

### complexity assessment

| aspect | verdict | notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| filediff scope | ✅ minimal | only 4 files need changes |
| codepath depth | ✅ shallow | max 3 levels of nest depth |
| branch patterns | ✅ simple | straightforward regex matches |
| validation logic | ✅ linear | early returns, no nested conditions |
| new flags | ✅ one | only --promise is-netnew-behavior added |
| contract changes | ✅ additive | adds source field, no contract breaks |

### simplification opportunities reviewed

| area | current approach | simpler alternative? | verdict |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|---------|
| branch inference | regex in bash | no — bash regex is native and fast | ✅ keep |
| ambiguity detection | check both fix+feat flags | no — straightforward and clear | ✅ keep |
| hard-nudge message | multi-line output | no — clarity requires explanation | ✅ keep |
| test cases | 15 total tests | no — coverage is proportional to behavior | ✅ keep |
| helper functions | 3 bash functions | no — single responsibility per function | ✅ keep |

### what was kept simple

1. **single responsibility**: each helper function does one task
2. **explicit over implicit**: patterns are listed verbatim in blueprint
3. **early returns**: validation uses linear flow with early exits
4. **additive changes**: no contract breaks
5. **no new dependencies**: uses native bash features only

### what could tempt excess complexity

| temptation | why avoided |
|------------|-------------|
| config file for patterns | patterns are stable, hardcoded is fine |
| plugin system for validators | single use case, not needed |
| abstract base classes | bash scripts, keep procedural |
| external pattern library | native bash regex sufficient |

### gaps detected

none — blueprint is appropriately simple for the scope.

### verdict

blueprint maintains simplicity while it fulfills all criteria and vision requirements. no excess complexity detected.
