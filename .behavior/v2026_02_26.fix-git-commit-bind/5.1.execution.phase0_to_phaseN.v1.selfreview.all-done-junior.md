# self-review: 5.1.execution.phase0_to_phaseN.v1 — all-done-junior

## junior review against blueprint and criteria

reviewed execution as if a junior mechanic implemented it.

### blueprint codepath alignment

| codepath element | blueprint | implemented | verified |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| infer_level_from_branch() in bind.sh | [+] | ✅ | smoke test |
| explicit bind checked first | [○] | ✅ | code review |
| branch inference fallback | [+] | ✅ | smoke test |
| get output shows source | [~] | ✅ | smoke test |
| --promise flag parse | [+] | ✅ | code review |
| is_merge_commit() helper | [+] | ✅ (defined, not used) | n/a |
| get_commit_prefix() helper | [+] | ✅ | code review |
| skip chore/docs/refactor | [+] | ✅ | code review |
| fix level blocks feat | [○] | ✅ | code review |
| feat level blocks fix | [○] | ✅ | code review |
| no level + feat = hard-nudge | [+] | ✅ | code review |
| --promise bypass nudge | [+] | ✅ | code review |

### criteria usecase coverage

| usecase | criteria | implemented |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| 1: infer from branch | fix/feat patterns | ✅ infer_level_from_branch() |
| 2: explicit overrides | explicit checked first | ✅ LEVEL_FILE check before inference |
| 3: hard-nudge | feat without signal blocked | ✅ with --promise bypass |
| 4: explicit on ambiguous | explicit removes nudge | ✅ covered by explicit-first check |
| 5: source in output | level + source shown | ✅ turtle output format |

### boundary conditions

| condition | criteria | implemented |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| ambiguous branch | both signals = none | ✅ has_fix && has_feat check |
| merge commit | skip validation | ⚠️ helper defined, not used |

### gaps detected

1. **merge commit skip not wired** — is_merge_commit() defined but not called in validation logic. however, git.commit.set creates new commits, not merge commits. merge commits are created by git merge, so this check is not applicable to the current flow. documented in execution notes.

### verdict

junior's work aligns with blueprint and criteria. core functionality complete. merge commit logic is correctly scoped out — git.commit.set does not create merge commits.
