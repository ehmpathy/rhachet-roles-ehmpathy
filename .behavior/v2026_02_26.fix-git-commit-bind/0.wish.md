wish =

for the git commit skill, we have already a git.commit.bind skill that binds the commit to eather a fix / feat

well, instead of need to imperatively bind

we should also have that git.commit.bind _infer_ the bind from the branch name

support

- feat/xyz
- fix/xyz
- $name/feat/xyz
- $name/fix/xyz
- $name/fix-xyz
- $name/feat-xyz


---

also, if there is not a bind, we should hard-nudge the caller and ask them: 'are you certain this is a feat? it adds new behavior that did not exist and was not intended to be covered by extnat behavior? or is this a fix that covers a gap from prior implementation or tunes the implementation'

and require it to --promise is-netnew-behavior if it tries to commit as a feat without being bound
