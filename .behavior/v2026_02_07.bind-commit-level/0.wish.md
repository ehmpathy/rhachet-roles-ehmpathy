cool. now, we want the human to be able to prescribe whether they think this work is a fix or a feat. lets follow the       
  .bind/*.flag pattern established in .behavior/* dirs that flattens the branch name to bind config to it                     
                                                                                                                              
  the human should be able to git.commit.bind --level feat | fix                                                         

  then git.commit.set shoud reject any that dont satisfy it
