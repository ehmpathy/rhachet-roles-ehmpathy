wish =

compressed and deduped the briefs in domain.roles/mechanic/briefs

theres duplicates
theres verbosity
theres inconsistency in standard


---

ideally, we'd declare them in terms of

briefs/practices/code.prod.x,y,z

with

directive = [require, prefer, avoid, forbid]

and surdomains of
- code.prod = production codepaths
- code.test = test codepaths
- flow = work flows; how to approach code
- lang.terms = what ubiq lang terms to use
- lang.tones = what tones to use

and then the subdomains can be scoped within each surdomain


---

we can probably get rid of the best-practice and bad-practices dirs, in favor of just the directives within the file names


---

i'd like you to go look at all the .mds in the briefs dir already and then propose a restructure of how to fit them all into

briefs/practices/$surdomain/$subdomain/$directive.$topic.md


specifically,

for each md currently in that dir, we should see a proposal for what file to move it into

and if there's multiple source markdowns that we propose to move into the same target markdown, then we should see each listed under it

use a treestruct to identify them

---

dont try and blend the docs yet. just identify where we'll want to cluster them.

emit your proposal into

.behavior/v2025_12_22.compress-briefs/3.blueprint.i1.md
