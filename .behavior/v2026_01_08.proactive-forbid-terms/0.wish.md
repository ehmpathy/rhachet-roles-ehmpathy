wish =

proactively forbid forbidden terms

follow the pattern established by the forbid.gerunds hook

to create a new hook called forbid.terms.blocklist

(also, rename forbid.gerunds as forbid.terms.gerunds)

---

we'd like to keep a .jsonc doc of terms to forbid

include to start
-  { term: 'script', why: '', alt: ['command', 'executable', 'procedure', 'operation', 'mechanism']}


have it be a list json list of {term, why, alt}

for script, pull the why from your rules briefs, they explain why

---

we'll plan to addon to the jsonc terms.blocklist.jsonc over time
