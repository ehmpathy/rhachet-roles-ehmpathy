# .meter

This directory tracks metered permissions for AI mechanics.

## Why it exists

Mechanics (AI agents) need explicit human permission to perform certain actions
like git commits and pushes. The `.meter` directory stores the current quota state:

- How many commits the mechanic is allowed to make
- Whether push is permitted
- Other metered capabilities

## How it works

1. Human grants permission: `git.commit.uses set --allow N --push allow|block`
2. State is written to `.meter/git.commit.uses.jsonc`
3. Mechanic checks quota before committing
4. Each commit decrements the counter
5. When quota hits zero, mechanic must ask human for more

## Security

**The mechanic cannot modify files in this directory.**

Write access to `.meter/` is denied in the permissions denylist. This prevents
the mechanic from granting itself unlimited commits or enabling push without
human approval.

Only human-invoked commands can modify the quota state.

## Files

- `git.commit.uses.jsonc` - commit quota and push permission state
