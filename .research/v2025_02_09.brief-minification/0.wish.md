wish = 

create an .agent/repo=.this/role=compressor/breifs dir and in there do a ton of research on telegraphic semantic            
  compression and how it can be used to minify briefs for robos without loss of knowledge

include
- how we can do evals to test loss vs compression rate

- what are guaranteed terms that can be dropped, vs what is questionable

- real world case study results

- how we can apply this to our mechanic briefs
