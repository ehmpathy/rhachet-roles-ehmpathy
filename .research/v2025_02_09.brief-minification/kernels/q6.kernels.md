## [FACT] Zipf's Law Mathematical Formulation

Zipf's Law describes word frequency as inversely proportional to rank: f(r) ∝ 1/(r+β)^α where α≈1 and β≈2.7. The most frequent word has frequency proportional to 1, the second most frequent word has frequency proportional to 1/2^α.

## [FACT] Shannon's Information-Surprisal Principle

Information content is inversely proportional to probability: I(x) = -log(P(x)). Rare events carry more information than common events because they generate greater surprise.
