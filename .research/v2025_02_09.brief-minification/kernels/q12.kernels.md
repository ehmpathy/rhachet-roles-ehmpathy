## [SUMP] Kernels - Assumptions Not Explicitly Proven

### S1: Standard Benchmarks Focus on Task Performance
Traditional prompt compression benchmarks primarily measure downstream task accuracy rather than instruction adherence or role preservation.
**Source**: General analysis across LLMLingua and related works

### S2: Verifiability Requirement for Compressed Instructions
If "write in 400+ words" gets compressed to "write detailed response," the instruction becomes unverifiable; this suggests compressed instructions may lose their verifiability property.

Hard prompt methods (token removal) may preserve explicit instructions better than soft methods (learned embed), but neither is evaluated specifically for role compliance.
