## Extracted Knowledge Kernels

### [FACT] Semantic compression achievable rate with state-of-the-art models
Current research establishes that semantic compression can approach 0.69-0.70 bits/character for natural language with state-of-the-art language models.
**Source:** arXiv 2306.02305

### [FACT] Phase transition threshold for lossless semantic compression
A critical result shows the existence of a phase transition at approximately α* ≈ 0.4049 relative embedded dimension, beyond which lossless semantic compression becomes impossible.
**Source:** arXiv 2306.02305

### [FACT] Lossy semantic compression achievable reduction ratios
Theoretical semantic compression limits for lossy compression can achieve 5-10× length reduction while it preserves semantic content.
**Source:** Research synthesis from 13 primary sources

### [FACT] Theoretical framework extends Shannon information theory
The field extends classical Shannon information theory to incorporate semantic content, task-relevance, and Bayesian network structures that characterize compression limits.
**Source:** arXiv 2306.02305

### [SUMP] Task-specificity of semantic distance measures
Theoretical bounds depend on task-specific semantic distance measures, which implies that compression limits vary based on the specific semantic preservation requirements of different applications.
**Source:** Implicit assumption in research framework

### [SUMP] Semantic compression differs from symbol-level compression
Semantic compression maintains semantic content rather than exact symbol reproduction, which represents a fundamentally different paradigm from classical information-theoretic compression.
**Source:** Research frame from arXiv 2306.02305

### [SUMP] State-of-the-art language models enable approach to theoretical limits
The achievement of 0.69-0.70 bits/character assumes the use of state-of-the-art language models, which implies that model quality directly impacts achievable compression rates.
**Source:** Implicit in stated results

### [HYPO] Bayesian network models can establish foundational bounds
Bayesian network models provide a foundational framework to establish theoretical bounds on semantic compression.
**Source:** arXiv 2306.02305 methodology

### [HYPO] Phase transition represents fundamental limit
The phase transition at α* ≈ 0.4049 represents a fundamental information-theoretic boundary rather than a practical limit from technical constraints.
**Source:** arXiv 2306.02305 theoretical results

### [KHUE] Context-dependency of compression limits
How do theoretical semantic compression limits vary across different contexts for language, domains, and semantic preservation requirements?
**Source:** Implied by "context-dependent" characterization in key results

### [KHUE] Practical achievability of theoretical bounds
What gap exists between theoretical compression limits (0.69 bits/character lossless, 5-10× lossy) and practically achievable compression rates with current technology?
**Source:** Implied by theoretical vs. practical distinction

### [KHUE] Relationship between embedded dimension and semantic preservation
What is the precise relationship between relative embedded dimension (α) and semantic information preservation across the phase transition boundary?
**Source:** Phase transition result at α* ≈ 0.4049

### [KHUE] Trade-offs between compression ratio and semantic fidelity
What are the quantitative trade-offs between compression ratio and semantic fidelity across different levels of lossy compression?
**Source:** Range from lossless (0.69 bits/char) to lossy (5-10× reduction)

### [KHUE] Application of task-relevance metrics in practice
How can task-relevance metrics be practically defined and measured for different semantic compression applications?
**Source:** Framework that incorporates "task-relevance" in theoretical bounds
