## ASSUMPTIONS - Claims Assumed But Not Explicitly Proven

### Psychoacoustic Model Assumptions

**[SUMP-001]** MP3 compression assumes that very high frequencies above 16 kHz are inaudible, though their loss can rob music of subtle overtones, presence, dynamic range, and depth of field.
- Source: White (2008), Sound on Sound
- Assumption: Human hear limitations justify to eliminate high frequencies

**[SUMP-002]** Perceptual audio encode assumes fixed playback levels, ignores that human ability to perceive details changes with playback volume.
- Source: White (2008), Sound on Sound
- Assumption: Listen conditions are constant and predictable

### Medical Image Assumptions

**[SUMP-003]** The means by which visually lossless thresholds are determined experimentally may be insufficient to guarantee diagnostic performance, particularly for difficult tasks that involve low-contrast detection, require high frequency information to be preserved, require texture to be preserved, or are vulnerable to compression artifact to be misinterpreted as false positive findings.
- Source: Koff & Shulman (2014)
- Assumption: Visual losslessness equals diagnostic losslessness

**[SUMP-004]** Radiologists often resist to interpret visibly degraded images despite evidence that high performance equivalent to uncompressed images can be achieved for some modalities.
- Source: European Society of Radiology position paper (2011)
- Assumption: Visible degradation correlates with diagnostic degradation

### Scientific Data Assumptions

**[SUMP-005]** Those who generate and possibly compress scientific output data often do not know how the data will be analyzed in the future.
- Source: Sarasota Workshop Report (2024)
- Assumption: Current analysis methods represent all future analysis needs

**[SUMP-006]** Compression algorithms based on current physical theories may "compress away" the information needed to study extended theories if the physical theory is not correct.
- Source: Astronomical data compression research (2020-2024)
- Assumption: Current theoretical knowledge is complete enough to guide compression decisions

### General Compression Assumptions

**[SUMP-007]** Compression decisions implicitly predict which information will and will not be needed in the future, but these predictions are frequently wrong because future analysis methods are unknown, future questions are unknowable, current perceptual models may not match actual use cases, and anomalies that seem like noise may be the most valuable information.
- Source: Research synthesis conclusions
- Assumption: Present knowledge adequately predicts future information needs

## HYPOTHESES - Claims Proposed But Not Yet Tested

### Compression Failure Mechanisms

**[HYPO-001]** Compression is most valuable precisely where it is most dangerous: high-value applications (medical diagnosis, forensic evidence, scientific discovery, military intelligence) generate large data volumes that benefit most from compression, but these same applications have the lowest tolerance for information loss because the stakes are highest.
- Source: Research synthesis - "The Fundamental Compression Paradox"
- Testability: Could be validated through systematic analysis of compression adoption rates versus error tolerance across domains

**[HYPO-002]** Compression failures rarely manifest as dramatic single-point catastrophes but instead create systematic degradation of decision-make quality through false negatives, false positives, foreclosed discoveries, progressive degradation, and permanent inaccessibility.
- Source: Research synthesis - Final Assessment
- Testability: Longitudinal studies track decision quality in compressed versus uncompressed data environments

**[HYPO-003]** Use of current theory to decide what information to compress may eliminate precisely the anomalous data needed to study extended theories, creates an epistemological trap where compression decisions based on current knowledge prevent to expand that knowledge.
- Source: Astronomical data compression research synthesis
- Testability: Historical analysis of scientific breakthroughs from anomalous data that would have been compressed away

### Domain-Specific Hypotheses

**[HYPO-004]** Compression artifacts in medical CAD systems cause false positives by introduce features that meet algorithm requirements but do not represent genuine pathology, potentially worse than simple information loss.
- Source: Medical image synthesis
- Testability: Controlled studies compare CAD performance on compressed versus uncompressed images

**[HYPO-005]** In forensic video analysis, I-frame versus P-frame compression quality differences create temporal inconsistency in evidence appearance that can lead to false conclusions about scene characteristics.
- Source: Amped Software forensic video analysis
- Testability: Systematic test of evidence consistency across frame types in compressed surveillance footage

**[HYPO-006]** Audio compression temporal smear (2ms impulse becomes 35+ms) makes professional mix decisions impossible to evaluate accurately because engineer decisions about transient attacks cannot be reliably perceived.
- Source: Audio engineer synthesis
- Testability: Blind A/B test with professional audio engineers compare mix decisions on compressed versus uncompressed audio

**[HYPO-007]** Text summarization faces a scale-dependent difficulty where to determine what information is valuable becomes exponentially harder as source document length increases relative to fixed summary length.
- Source: Text summarization research synthesis
- Testability: Measure summarization quality metrics across varied source document lengths with constant summary lengths

### Temporal Failure Hypotheses

**[HYPO-008]** Generation loss in repeated compression creates "unexpected and potentially dangerous side effects" that compound non-linearly, makes third or fourth generation copies qualitatively different from first generation copies.
- Source: European Society of Radiology position paper, VHS generation loss research
- Testability: Systematic measurement of quality degradation across compression generations with varied algorithms and parameters

**[HYPO-009]** Long-term scientific data becomes permanently inaccessible when decompression tools become obsolete, creates reproducibility failures where data lifetime (possibly indefinite) exceeds technology support lifetime (finite).
- Source: Sarasota Workshop Report
- Testability: Survey of archived compressed scientific data and availability of work decompression tools

### Content-Dependency Hypotheses

**[HYPO-010]** There is no universal "safe" compression ratio because content-dependent failure means identical compression parameters preserve diagnostic quality for some anatomies but render others "completely unusable" even within the same medical image modality.
- Source: Langer et al. (2015), CT compression research
- Testability: Systematic test of compression ratios across anatomical regions with diagnostic quality assessment

**[HYPO-011]** Climate data with uncorrelated dimensions causes mispredictions in prediction-based compressors, results in either lower compression ratios or higher information loss compared to data with correlated dimensions.
- Source: Sarasota Workshop Report
- Testability: Comparative compression performance analysis on datasets with varied dimensional correlation patterns

### Artifact Interpretation Hypotheses

**[HYPO-012]** Compression does not just remove information but adds false information through artifacts that can be misinterpreted as genuine signal, particularly in automated analysis systems not trained on compressed data artifacts.
- Source: Synthesis of medical CAD, forensic video, and audio forensics research
- Testability: Train automated systems with and without compressed data artifacts and measure false positive/negative rates

**[HYPO-013]** When radiologists resist to interpret visibly degraded compressed images, their resistance may be justified by inability to distinguish compression artifacts from pathology, even when objective performance metrics suggest "visually lossless" compression.
- Source: European Society of Radiology synthesis
- Testability: Measure radiologist diagnostic confidence and artifact-pathology discrimination ability across compression levels

### Prediction Failure Hypotheses

**[HYPO-014]** Satellite image compression creates a unique failure mode where information is permanently lost before intelligence analysts can assess its value, because transmission bandwidth limitations force compression decisions at point of capture.
- Source: Satellite image compression research synthesis
- Testability: Analysis of intelligence failures potentially attributable to pre-capture compression decisions

**[HYPO-015]** Blockchain compression that loses any data potentially breaks the chain of verification, destroys not just content but the mathematical proof of authenticity and immutability that gives blockchains their integrity properties.
- Source: Blockchain compression research synthesis
- Testability: Cryptographic verification test on blockchains with various compression schemes

## SYNTHESIS PATTERNS

### Five Fundamental Compression Failure Mechanisms

**[FACT-022]** Five systematic patterns of compression failure were identified across 14 authoritative sources:
1. **Unknowable Future Requirements**: Compression decisions made before know what information future analysis will require
2. **Artifact Misinterpretation as Signal**: Compression artifacts mistaken for genuine information
3. **Generation Loss Amplification**: Cumulative degradation through repeated compression cycles
4. **Content-Dependent Failure**: Identical parameters produce vastly different outcomes depend on content
5. **Irreversible Context Elimination**: Systematic elimination of specific information types (transients, high frequencies, color data, etc.)
- Source: Cross-domain synthesis across all 14 sources

### Regulatory Recognition

**[FACT-023]** Regulatory and institutional bodies have established explicit prohibitions and guidelines that recognize compression risks: FDA prohibition on lossy mammography compression, ESR detailed compression guidelines, and domain-specific standards developed by domain experts rather than compression engineers alone.
- Source: FDA regulations, ESR position paper

### Economic Impact

**[FACT-024]** JPEG degradation in e-commerce proves especially problematic because business success largely depends on visual appeal of products, demonstrates compression failures extend beyond technical metrics into economic consequences.
