## [FACT] Kernels - Grounded, Provable Knowledge

### F1. Shannon Entropy Baseline for English
Natural English text has a character-level entropy of 0.6-1.58 bits per character, compared to a theoretical maximum of 4.7 bits per character for uniform character distribution.
- Source: Shannon (1951), Guerrero (2009)

### F2. Natural Language Redundancy Rate
Natural English text exhibits 74-75% redundancy, meaning approximately three-quarters of the content is predictable or redundant.
- Source: Stanford CS (Roberts 1999-2000), Guerrero (2009)

### F3. Shannon's Entropy Definition
Entropy is a statistical parameter that measures how much information is produced on average for each letter of a text, defined as H = -Σp(x)log2p(x) where p(x) is the probability of character x.
- Source: Shannon (1951), Hassan et al. (2024)

### F4. Entropy as Compression Lower Bound
Shannon's source code theorem proves that entropy represents an absolute mathematical limit on how well data can be losslessly compressed - no compression scheme can compress below the entropy rate without information loss.
- Source: Wikipedia, Britannica, GridFour (Lucasig)

### F5. Standard Text Compression Performance
Most text files compress by approximately 50%, reducing to approximately 4 bits per character, which aligns with entropy calculations.
- Source: Guerrero (2009)

### F6. PPM Algorithm Compression Achievement
The PPM (Prediction by Partial Matching) compression algorithm achieves compression ratios of 1.5-2.2 bits per character for English text, approaching theoretical entropy limits.
- Source: Mahoney (Large Text Compression Benchmark)

### F7. Clinical Documentation Redundancy Rates
Clinical text studies found that signout notes and progress notes contain 78% and 54% of duplicated information from previous documents respectively.
- Source: Cohen et al. (2011)

### F8. Semantic vs Lexical Redundancy Detection
Semantic-based redundancy detection methods can identify up to 90% of redundancy, compared to only 19% for lexical-based methods.
- Source: Cohen et al. (2011)

### F9. Character Frequency Predictability
In English text, 'e' is far more common than 'z', combination 'qu' is much more common than other 'q' combinations, and 'th' is more common than 'z', 'q', or 'qu'.
- Source: Young (UT Austin CS361)

### F10. Language-Specific Redundancy Variations
Different languages exhibit variant redundancy levels - German shows 71.68% redundancy and Dutch shows 70.82% redundancy, suggesting strong structure in character sequences.
- Source: Bentz et al. (2016)

### F11. Context Increases Predictability
Higher-order entropy measurements (which consider more context) show greater reduction, indicating that context increases predictability in text.
- Source: Bentz et al. (2016)

### F12. Entropy Correlation with Reading Speed
Increases in surprisal and entropy reduction are both associated with increases in reading times in natural reading experiments.
- Source: Luke & Christianson (2018)

### F13. Entropy-Readability Inverse Relationship
Higher entropy values correspond with lower readability for beginning readers - more predictable text (lower entropy) is easier to read.
- Source: Hassan et al. (2024)

### F14. Compression Ratio Variation by Text Type
Compression performance varies significantly with text characteristics - more repetitive text achieves better compression ratios.
- Source: Grabowski & Deorowicz (2020), Mahoney

### F15. Natural Language Structural Constraints
Natural languages contain significant redundancy due to constraints such as "i before e except after c" and "q must be followed by u".
- Source: Stanford CS (Roberts 1999-2000)

A minimum threshold of 20-30% redundancy is necessary for error correction and resilience in instruction text.
