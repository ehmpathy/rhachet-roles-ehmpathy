## Methodology & Evaluation Approaches

### [FACT] Three evaluation methodologies exist for LLM judges
Current approaches leverage LLMs' contextual reason capabilities through three evaluation methodologies: Pointwise (score individual outputs), Pairwise (compare two outputs), and Pass/Fail assessments.
**Source:** EvidentlyAI (2025)

### [FACT] Pairwise comparison leads to more stable results than pointwise score
Studies show that pairwise comparisons lead to more stable results and smaller differences between LLM judgments and human annotations relative to direct score; pointwise score tends to be less stable as absolute scores are more likely to fluctuate.

Self-consistency boosts the performance of chain-of-thought prompts with strong margins on reason benchmarks, which include GSM8K (+17.9%), SVAMP (+11.0%), AQuA (+12.2%), StrategyQA (+6.4%), and ARC-challenge (+3.9%).
**Source:** Wang et al. (2022), ArXiv preprint 2203.11171

### [FACT] Self-consistency samples diverse reason paths and selects most consistent answer
Self-consistency is a decode strategy that replaces greedy decode by sample of a diverse set of reason paths and selection of the most consistent answer by marginalization out of the sampled reason paths.
**Source:** Wang et al. (2022), ArXiv preprint 2203.11171

### [FACT] Self-consistency is unsupervised and requires no fine-tune
Self-consistency is entirely unsupervised, works off-the-shelf with pre-trained language models, requires no additional human annotation, and avoids any additional train, auxiliary models or fine-tune.

### [FACT] SAGE framework introduces IPI and TOV metrics for consistency
SAGE (Self-Assesses Gauge for Evaluators) proposes two novel metrics: Intra-Pair Instability (IPI) to assess local, pairwise consistency, and Weak Total Order Violation (TOV) to measure global, logical coherence.
**Source:** ArXiv preprint 2510.27106 (October 2025)

### [FACT] Krippendorff's α is standard metric to measure self-consistency
Higher Krippendorff's α indicates the sampled responses are more consistently similar; this is a standard metric used to measure self-consistency in LLM evaluation frameworks.
**Source:** ArXiv preprint 2510.27106 (October 2025)
