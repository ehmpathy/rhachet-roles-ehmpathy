## [FACT] Kernels - Grounded, Provable Knowledge

### F1: Regulatory Compliance Documentation
**Kernel:** Technical writers support regulatory compliance through thorough documentation that helps ensure organizations remain compliant by creation of records of evaluations, issues, and steps taken to address them.
**Source:** MDN Blog - "Create effective technical documentation"

### F2: Compliance Trends Shift from Documentation to Behavior
**Kernel:** Good compliance in 2025-2026 is behavioral. Enforcement agencies globally assess whether organizations live in their policies, not just publish them. Core evaluation criteria include train, tone from leadership, and transparent whistleblower channels.
**Source:** Truzta - "What 'Good Compliance' Looks Like in 2026"

### F3: Bite-Sized Train Effectiveness
**Kernel:** Bite-sized, scenario-based train reinforces how daily choices influence overall program outcomes and corporate reputation. This proves more effective than verbose policy documentation.
**Source:** Truzta - "What 'Good Compliance' Looks Like in 2026"

### F4: FAA Safety-Critical Information Requirements
**Kernel:** Required safety-critical information includes all design and operational details, intended functions, failure modes, and mode annunciations of autopilot and autothrottle systems. The FAA proposes performance-based regulatory requirements for certification plans that contain sufficient information for compliance show and find.
**Source:** Federal Register - "Disclosure of Safety-Critical Information"

### F5: Transient Information Effect
**Kernel:** If information presented through auditory means is long and complex, it taxes the cognitive system rather than helps it. This creates a transient information effect where long explanations become short-lived in memory because the information exceeds the brain's cognitive load capability.
**Source:** Structural Learn - "Cognitive Load Theory: A teacher's guide"

### F6: Redundancy Reduction Effect
**Kernel:** When several sources repeat the same information simultaneously (e.g., add extremely detailed labels to a diagram that accompanies a text description that conveys the same information), repetition is not helpful for learn.
**Source:** Structural Learn - "Cognitive Load Theory: A teacher's guide"

### F7: ANSI Z535 Warn Standard Effectiveness
**Kernel:** Studies indicate that warns consistent with the ANSI Z535 standard were rated as more noticed, read, and understood. They promoted greater compliance compared with warns inconsistent with the standard.
**Source:** Association of Equipment Manufacturers - "Label Matters"

### F8: Laboratory vs. Real-World Warn Compliance Gap
**Kernel:** Warn labels have been shown to increase compliance in controlled laboratory studies where participants are aware they are studied. However, real-world observational studies often find no relationship between warn labels and compliance behavior.
**Source:** Association of Equipment Manufacturers - "Label Matters"

### F9: Medical Non-Adherence Rates
**Kernel:** 20% to 30% of new prescriptions are never filled at the pharmacy. Medication is not taken as prescribed 50% of the time. Rates of nonadherence with any medication treatment vary from 15% to 93%, with an average estimated rate of 50% worldwide.
**Source:** PMC (PubMed Central) - "Patient Compliance: Fact or Fiction?"

### F10: Inadequate Medical Instructions
**Kernel:** Physicians and pharmacists have not always provided patients with adequate instructions or presented them in a manner that patients understand. This contributes to non-compliance.
**Source:** PMC (PubMed Central) - "Patient Compliance: Fact or Fiction?"

### F11: Plain Language Laws Prevalence
**Kernel:** 496 statutes and regulations spread across the United States require plain language in private sector contracts and related documents.
**Source:** Contract Nerds - "496 U.S. Laws Require Plain Language Contracts"

### F12: Legal Jargon as Precision Shorthand
**Kernel:** A lot of 'jargon' is just shorthand for precision. Latin phrases and set terms are present to say complex content quickly and consistently.
**Source:** Contract Nerds - "496 U.S. Laws Require Plain Language Contracts"

### F13: Novice vs. Expert Documentation Needs
**Kernel:** Beginners often need more explanations, context, and examples. Experienced users prefer concise, straight-to-the-point instructions. Expert users value speed, customization, and shortcuts. Novice users value simplicity, clarity, and support.
**Source:** Nielsen Norman Group - "Novice vs. Expert Users"

### F14: Expert Interface Requirements
**Kernel:** Experts can require extensive features, visual clutter, and a much larger information display density than the novice. The user interface that encourages learn is not necessarily the right interface for the expert.
**Source:** Nielsen Norman Group - "Novice vs. Expert Users"

### F15: Verbose Mode Troubleshoot Effectiveness
**Kernel:** Troubleshoot of complex issues is more effective with verbose mode because log messages expose the exact point of failure. Detailed output reduces guesswork by the narrow of potential problem sources. Error report within verbose mode often includes exit codes, error codes, and module-specific alerts.
**Source:** phoenixNAP IT Glossary - "What Is Verbose Mode?"

### F16: Security Requirements for Error Messages
**Kernel:** For security reasons, you should generally not display detailed verbose error messages to end-users. In development environments, verbose error messages can be enabled for debug purposes. Production environments should have these set disabled to prevent expose of sensitive information.
**Source:** phoenixNAP IT Glossary - "What Is Verbose Mode?"

### F17: Ambiguity and Self-Serve Interpretation
**Kernel:** Situations in which ambiguity is high are especially prone to self-serve interpretation of available information.
**Source:** Wiley Online Library - "Ambiguity and legal compliance"

### F18: Ambiguity Definition
**Kernel:** Ambiguity arises when available information lacks sufficient context or a shared frame. People cannot reliably determine what the problem is, what matters, what causes what, or what solution would count as correct.
**Source:** Wiley Online Library - "Ambiguity and legal compliance"

### F19: Progressive Disclosure Usability Benefits
**Kernel:** Progressive disclosure improves 3 of usability's 5 components: learnability, efficiency of use, and error rate.
**Source:** Nielsen Norman Group - "Progressive Disclosure"

### F20: Single Layer Disclosure Limit
**Kernel:** A single secondary screen is typically sufficient for each instance of progressive disclosure. Multiple layers can confuse users and make the find of 'buried' functionality hard.
**Source:** Nielsen Norman Group - "Progressive Disclosure"

### F21: WCAG Alt Text Requirements
**Kernel:** Alt text is a minimum accessibility requirement. You cannot reach any WCAG conformance level (A, AA, AAA) without it. Text alternatives should be provided for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
**Source:** W3C - "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1"

### F22: Alt Text Length Guideline
**Kernel:** When clear and concise alt-text image descriptions are provided, screen readers can read the description. This allows users to understand the full mean of the non-text content. However, brevity is important: if alt text goes much past 125 characters, you probably use more words than are really necessary.
**Source:** W3C - "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1"

### F23: Complex Image Alt Text Exception
**Kernel:** Complex images on web pages, such as graphs, charts, or diagrams, may contain too much information to be effectively described via text in an ALT attribute. Instead they must be described with a longer description to provide equivalent access.
**Source:** W3C - "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1"

### F24: Onboard Information Overload
**Kernel:** Common mistakes in user onboard include overwhelm of users with too much information, not provide clear next steps, and failure to track user progress or gather feedback.
**Source:** UserGuide - "100+ User Onboard Statistics You Need to Know in 2026"

### F25: Product Tours vs. Walkthroughs
**Kernel:** Product tours dump a lot of information, often in irrelevant situations. Walkthroughs direct users to the key activation points contextually and at their pace. They appear only after customers successfully finish previous steps.
**Source:** UserGuide - "100+ User Onboard Statistics You Need to Know in 2026"

## [SUMP] Kernels - Assumptions

### S1: Documentation Structure for Non-Essential Compliance
**Kernel:** If non-essential information does need to be documented for compliance or other reasons, it should be included as supplementary content, like an appendix. This way it's available but doesn't distract from the core content.
**Source:** MDN Blog - "Create effective technical documentation"
**Assumption:** Users will consult appendices when needed. That relegate of compliance content to appendices maintains usability.

### S2: Sufficient Information Standard
**Kernel:** The FAA proposes establish of performance-based regulatory requirements for certification plans that contain "sufficient" information for compliance show. However, safety standards mandate adequate evidence but are often vague on what adequate means in a particular context.
**Source:** Federal Register - "Disclosure of Safety-Critical Information"
**Assumption:** Regulatory bodies can objectively determine "sufficient" or "adequate" levels of detail for safety-critical contexts.

### S3: Implementation Matters More Than Documentation
**Kernel:** For years, privacy policies got the attention while implementation stayed in the background. Regulators make it clear that how you implement your policies matters just as much as how you write them.
**Source:** Truzta - "What 'Good Compliance' Looks Like in 2026"
**Assumption:** Behavioral compliance assessment is more accurate than documentation review to determine actual organizational compliance.

### S4: Cognitive Load Reduction Through Simplification
**Kernel:** By simplify of the ideas you want to convey, provide individual, easy-to-understand explanations of each issue and remove superfluous details, you can reduce extraneous cognitive load to make your presentation more memorable to listeners.
**Source:** Structural Learn - "Cognitive Load Theory: A teacher's guide"
**Assumption:** Simplification always reduces cognitive load without loss of critical information necessary for comprehension.

### S5: Warn Label Design Elements
**Kernel:** To be effective, warn labels must be clear and concise, visible and legible, and specific with precise details about potential risks. Design elements such as bold text, color-coded alerts, and universally recognized symbols enhance label effectiveness.
**Source:** Association of Equipment Manufacturers - "Label Matters"
**Assumption:** Standardized design elements have universal recognition and effectiveness across different user populations and contexts.

### S6: Patient Understand and Motivation
**Kernel:** Compliance with therapy involves patients who understand medication and are motivated to take it as prescribed with the belief that the prescriber and medicine will be beneficial.
**Source:** PMC (PubMed Central) - "Patient Compliance: Fact or Fiction?"
**Assumption:** Understand and motivation are the primary drivers of patient compliance, rather than other factors like side effects, cost, or access barriers.

### S7: Legal Precision vs. Plain Language Tension
**Kernel:** While plain language is legally required in many cases, contract language needs to be as legally precise and comprehensive as possible to avoid any misinterpretations of purportedly ambiguous provisions.
**Source:** Contract Nerds - "496 U.S. Laws Require Plain Language Contracts"
**Assumption:** Legal precision and plain language can be reconciled, rather than fundamentally incompatible objectives.

### S8: User Research Defines Progressive Disclosure
**Kernel:** The critical factor to determine what to show when is user research. Designers must define essential and advanced content through user research.
**Source:** Nielsen Norman Group - "Progressive Disclosure"
**Assumption:** User research accurately identifies what content is essential versus advanced for target user populations.

### S9: Multiple Touchpoints Improve Onboard
**Kernel:** Some people may prefer to chat with a customer success manager, or watch detailed video tutorials. Provide multiple touchpoints empowers users to choose what works best for them, which in turn raises the completion rate for your onboard.
**Source:** UserGuide - "100+ User Onboard Statistics You Need to Know in 2026"
**Assumption:** Offer multiple learn modalities increases overall onboard success rates rather than fragments or confuses users.

### S10: Primary List Balance
**Kernel:** Designers have to disclose all that users frequently need up front. They have to progress to the secondary display only on rare occasions. Conversely, the primary list can't contain too many options or you'll fail to sufficiently focus users' attention on truly important issues.
**Source:** Nielsen Norman Group - "Progressive Disclosure"
**Assumption:** Frequency of need is the correct criterion for determination of primary versus secondary information hierarchy.

## [HYPO] Kernels - Hypotheses

### H1: Context-Dependent Verbosity Necessity
**Kernel:** Verbosity is necessary in specific, identifiable contexts (safety-critical systems, accessibility requirements, ambiguity resolution, novice learn, error recovery, regulatory mandates) rather than universally beneficial or harmful.
**Source:** Synthesis from multiple sources across the research

### H2: Progressive Disclosure Resolves Novice-Expert Tension
**Kernel:** Progressive disclosure resolves the tension between novice and expert needs by make verbosity optional rather than mandatory. This allows users to access detail when needed without force of all users through it.
**Source:** Nielsen Norman Group - "Progressive Disclosure" (with synthetic analysis)

### H3: Format Matters as Much as Content
**Kernel:** The warn label research reveals that format matters as much as content. Expansion improves compliance when it follows established standards, clear visual hierarchy, consistent structure and terminology, and recognizable patterns users can quickly parse.
**Source:** Association of Equipment Manufacturers - "Label Matters" (with synthetic analysis)

### H4: Expansion for Gap-Fill, Not Redundancy
**Kernel:** Expansion improves understand when it fills critical gaps in reason or makes implicit assumptions explicit. However, verbose redundant explanations actively harm comprehension by exceed of cognitive capacity.
**Source:** Structural Learn - "Cognitive Load Theory: A teacher's guide" (with synthetic analysis)

### H5: Verbosity Necessity Test
**Kernel:** Verbosity is necessary when removal of detail would result in safety risk, legal liability, accessibility barrier, systematic misinterpretation, novice failure, or diagnostic impossibility. If removal of detail does not create these outcomes, brevity is preferable.
**Source:** Synthesis from multiple sources across the research

### H6: Ambiguity as Primary Driver for Expansion
**Kernel:** Expansion is critical specifically when multiple interpretations are possible and stakes for misinterpretation are high. This is because ambiguity enables self-serve misinterpretation and non-compliance.
**Source:** Wiley Online Library - "Ambiguity and legal compliance" (with synthetic analysis)

### H7: Behavioral Compliance Over Documentation Compliance
**Kernel:** Brief, actionable, scenario-based instruction integrated into workflows proves more effective than verbose policy documentation to achieve actual behavioral compliance.
**Source:** Truzta - "What 'Good Compliance' Looks Like in 2026" (with synthetic analysis)

### H8: Standardization Enables Process
**Kernel:** Verbosity improves compliance specifically when it follows standardized formats (like ANSI Z535 for alerts or WCAG for accessibility) because standardization enables rapid pattern recognition and process despite increased length.
**Source:** Association of Equipment Manufacturers and W3C standards (with synthetic analysis)

### H9: User-Appropriate Detail Levels
**Kernel:** Documentation should adapt detail level based on user proficiency (novice, expert, technical troubleshooter, end user) rather than apply uniform verbosity or brevity. Different user types require fundamentally different information architectures.
**Source:** Nielsen Norman Group - "Novice vs. Expert Users" (with synthetic analysis)

### H10: Three-Layer Information Architecture
**Kernel:** Effective documentation architectures information in three layers. Primary layer contains essentials all users need frequently. Secondary layer provides detailed expansion available on-demand. Tertiary layer covers comprehensive references and edge cases. This optimizes for both learnability and efficiency.
**Source:** Nielsen Norman Group - "Progressive Disclosure" (with synthetic analysis)

### H11: Onboard Freedom Principle
**Kernel:** The most effective approach balances detailed information with simplicity. It provides users the freedom to access a minimal onboard experience, with an easy way to skip steps or access more detailed resources. This raises completion rates.
**Source:** UserGuide - "100+ User Onboard Statistics You Need to Know in 2026"

### H12: Contextual Sequential Disclosure
**Kernel:** Walkthroughs that direct users to key activation points contextually and at their pace, that appear only after customers successfully finish previous steps, are more effective than product tours that dump information in irrelevant situations.
**Source:** UserGuide - "100+ User Onboard Statistics You Need to Know in 2026" (with synthetic analysis)

### H13: Accessibility as Expansion Mandate
**Kernel:** Accessibility requirements represent a legal and ethical mandate for expansion where detailed alternative text is not optional but required by law for digital accessibility compliance. This makes verbosity necessary to provide access to users who cannot perceive content through standard channels.
**Source:** W3C - "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1" (with synthetic analysis)

### H14: Eight Critical Expansion Points
**Kernel:** Specific brief sections benefit from expansion: error messages (to diagnostic details), safety alerts (to specific risks), alt text for complex visuals (beyond 125 characters), ambiguous requirements (to prevent misinterpretation), onboard critical paths (with context), failure mode descriptions (beyond basic labels), regulatory disclosures (to meet legal standards), and step gaps in instructions (where assumptions cause failures).
**Source:** Synthesis from multiple sources across the research

## Key Insights for Brief Minification Research

### Primary Contribution
This research identifies specific contexts where verbosity is necessary rather than treat expansion as universally good or bad. The six contexts where expansion improves compliance (safety-critical, accessibility, ambiguity, novice learn, error recovery, regulatory mandates) provide clear decision criteria.

### Methodological Insight
The laboratory-versus-real-world compliance gap (F8) reveals that comprehension studies may not predict actual behavioral compliance. This suggests that brief minification research must test actual usage patterns, not just understand.

### Architectural Pattern
Progressive disclosure with three-layer architecture (H10) emerges as a resolution strategy that doesn't require choice between verbosity and brevity but instead makes detail available when needed.

### Critical Paradox
The compliance documentation paradox (F2, F3, H7) shows that regulatory requirements may mandate verbose documentation even when behavioral research proves brief, actionable instruction is more effective. This highlights a tension between legal compliance and practical effectiveness.
