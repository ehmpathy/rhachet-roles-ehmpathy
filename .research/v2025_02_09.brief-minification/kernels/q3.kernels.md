## FACTS [FACT]

### F1: LLM Syntactic Template Over-Reliance
LLMs develop an over-reliance on syntactic templates (patterns of parts of speech that frequently co-occur in train data), which leads to failures when questions are restructured with different syntax but identical mean.

## HYPOTHESES [HYPO]
