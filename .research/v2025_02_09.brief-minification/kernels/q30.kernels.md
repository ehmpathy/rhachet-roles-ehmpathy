**[FACT]** Optimal compression ratios vary dramatically across task types: Question Answering requires 2-5× compression, Chain-of-Thought Reason can handle 14-20× compression, Multi-Document QA benefits from 2-10× compression with accuracy improvements, and Code/Structured Data requires extractive compression.

### Layer-Specific Compression

**[FACT]** In deep networks, different layers have diverse degrees of sensitivity to quantization; early layers process entangled features are highly sensitive, while later layers handle semantic features tolerate lower precision.
- Source: arXiv paper on Mixed-Precision Quantization (2024)

**[FACT]** SensiMix applies 8-bit index quantization for sensitive components (input-layer encoders and Self-Attention layers) and 1-bit value quantization for insensitive components (output-layer feed-forward networks), achieves 8× model size reduction and ~5× faster inference (95 seconds vs. 480 seconds).
- Source: PLOS ONE article on SensiMix (2022)

**[FACT]** The Self-Attention layer is more important than FFN in an encoder because it calculates the relations between input word embed, which plays a crucial role to improve accuracy.
- Source: PLOS ONE article on SensiMix (2022)

**[FACT]** Encoders close to the input layer extract important low-level features from the input embed, which are crucial for model accuracy.
- Source: PLOS ONE article on SensiMix (2022)

**[FACT]** Sensitivity analysis shows that the type of neuron and the location in the network play an important role to determine sensitivity to compression, with initial layers generally more sensitive than layers toward the output.
- Source: Scientific Reports on carbon efficient AI (2025)

**[FACT]** The same convolution layer in ResNet56 exhibits different sensitivity to low-rank decomposition versus structured prune techniques.
- Source: Scientific Reports on carbon efficient AI (2025)

### Segment-Specific Compression

**[FACT]** LLMLingua assigns variable compression rates to different prompt segments: instructions receive 10-20% compression to preserve clarity, examples get 60-80% compression due to high redundancy, and questions receive minimal 0-10% compression to maintain critical intent.
- Source: Microsoft Research Blog on LLMLingua (2023)

**[FACT]** LLMLingua achieved up to 20× compression while preserved the original prompt's capabilities with only 1.5-point performance loss at maximum compression on GSM8K and BBH datasets.

### Deployment-Dependent Compression

**[FACT]** Different quantization bit-widths have specific characteristics: FP32 requires 280GB for 70-billion parameter model, FP16/BF16 reduces memory by half, INT8 provides quarter the original size, 4-bit achieves aggressive compression, and 1.58-bit (BitNet) uses ternary weights {-1, 0, 1} eliminates multiplication operations.

**[FACT]** Most AI models can be compressed by 80-95% with less than 2-3% accuracy degradation.
- Source: RunPod article on AI Model Compression (2024)

**[FACT]** Compression typically requires 2-5× the computational resources of original train, but the long-term deployment cost savings usually justify this investment within months.
- Source: RunPod article on AI Model Compression (2024)

### Context Window Characteristics

**[FACT]** A context window is the maximum text (measured in tokens) that an LLM can process in a single request; one word averages roughly 1.33 tokens, so 10,000 English words equal roughly 13,300 tokens.
- Source: Airbyte article on Large Context Windows (2024)

**[FACT]** Larger context windows come with significant costs: higher expenses at scale due to linear token price, increased latency before model output begins, U-shaped performance where middle content is often missed, and attention dilution when irrelevant information dominates context.
- Source: Airbyte article on Large Context Windows (2024)

### Compression Search Space

**[FACT]** For a network with L layers and n precision choices per layer, n^L different network configurations exist, makes brute force precision selection for each layer impractical.
- Source: arXiv paper on Mixed-Precision Quantization (2024)

**[FACT]** Methods formulate the mixed-precision quantization search problem as a one-shot integer linear program (ILP) problem, avoids iterative search and significantly reduces search span without limit to the bit-width search space.

## Summary Statistics

- **Total FACT kernels:** 43
- **Total SUMP kernels:** 12
- **Total KHUE kernels:** 11
- **Total HYPO kernels:** 18
- **Total kernels extracted:** 84

## Key Themes

1. **Task-dependent optimization:** Different tasks require dramatically different compression ratios (2× to 20×)
2. **Architecture-dependent sensitivity:** Compression techniques show variable effectiveness across model architectures (-6.7% to +32%)
3. **Layer-heterogeneous compression:** Within single models, different layers require different precision levels (1-bit to 16-bit)
4. **Segment-specific compression:** Even within prompts, different segments need different compression (0% to 80%)
5. **Adaptive superiority:** Adaptive approaches consistently outperform fixed approaches (2× to 10× efficiency gains)
6. **Deployment context matters:** Optimal compression varies by hardware, latency requirements, and cost constraints
7. **Emergent automation:** Automated adaptive systems are emerged that outperform manual tune

## Research Verdict

The evidence overwhelmingly supports adaptive compression over one-size-fits-all approaches across all dimensions analyzed: tasks, architectures, layers, segments, and deployment contexts. Fixed compression ratios either over-compress simple scenarios (lose accuracy) or under-compress complex scenarios (waste resources). Adaptive approaches achieve 2-10× better efficiency with equal or superior accuracy.
