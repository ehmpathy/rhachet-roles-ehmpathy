## FACTS [FACT]

### F1: Generic Stop Word Lists Are Inadequate for Domain-Specific Applications
Generic stop word lists like NLTK's 179-word list were developed from non-technical sources like the Brown Corpus and fail to identify domain-specific uninformative words when applied to specialized domains.
**Source:** Sarica & Luo (2021), PLOS ONE

### F2: Domain-Specific Stop Words Improve NLP Performance Significantly
In patent text classification with LSTM models: raw text achieved 84.9% accuracy, NLTK+USPTO stopwords achieved 95.9%, and all three lists achieved 97.0% accuracy—a 10-15 percentage point improvement.
**Source:** Sarica & Luo (2021), PLOS ONE

### F3: Legal Domain Stop Word Lists Are Substantially Larger Than Generic Lists
Brazilian legal text research produced a domain-specific list of 3,602 terms, compared to NLTK's 203 terms with minimal overlap—10-15x larger than generic lists.
**Source:** IEEE DataPort, Domain-Specific Stop Word List for Brazilian Legal Texts

### F4: Zipf's Law Describes Word Frequency Distribution
Zipf's Law states that the second most used word appears half as often as the most used word, the third appears one-third as often, with the formula f(r) = C/r^s, where f(r) is word frequency at rank r.
**Source:** GeeksforGeeks, Zipf's Law

### F5: Function Words Are Limited in Number But Highly Frequent
Function words belong to the closed class of words in grammar—it is very uncommon to have new function words created in the course of speech, yet they dominate actual usage frequency.

### F13: Function Words Serve Structural Rather Than Semantic Roles
Function words signal the structural relationships that words have to one another and are the glue that holds sentences together, with little lexical import or ambiguous import.
**Source:** Morphology Book, Content Words vs Function Words

### F14: Stop Word Removal Improves Processing Speed and Accuracy
When common words that do not contribute much to the context are removed, search systems are able to process data more quickly and accurately.

### H3: Brief-Specific Stop Words Can Improve NLP Performance by 10-15 Percentage Points
If extrapolated from patent domain results (84.9% to 97.0%), brief-specific stop words will similarly improve legal NLP task performance by 10-15 percentage points.
**Source:** Analogy from Sarica & Luo (2021)

### H4: Multi-Measure Convergence Indicates Strong Stop Word Candidates
Terms that score highly across multiple statistical measures (TF, IDF, TF-IDF, Shannon Entropy) are more likely to be valid stop words than those identified by a single measure.

**Source:** Synthesis of Brazilian legal texts categorization

### H8: Transformer Models Can Perform Context-Aware Stop Word Removal
Advanced NLP models like transformers (BERT, GPT) can understand contextual senses well enough to determine when terms like "motion" or "plaintiff" should be treated as stop words versus content words.
**Source:** APXML, Advanced Stop Word Removal Strategies

### H9: Information-Theoretic Measures Outperform Pure Frequency Counts
Entropy-based approaches that measure information content will identify better stop word candidates than simple frequency thresholds because they capture distributional patterns across document categories.
**Source:** Nature Machine Intelligence, information theoretic approach

### H10: Brief-Specific Stop Word Lists Will Be 5-10x Larger Than Generic Lists
If legal domain lists are 10-15x larger (3,602 vs 203 terms), brief-specific lists may be somewhat smaller but still 5-10x larger than generic lists due to specialized legal language.
**Source:** Extrapolation from Brazilian legal texts research

### H11: Conservative Start with Iterative Expansion Minimizes Risk
A start with a conservative list (~20-50 terms) and incremental expansion by 10-20 terms while performance impact is measured will prevent over-aggressive removal that loses semantic content.
**Source:** Synthesis of iterative refinement approaches

### H12: Document Length Normalization Prevents Bias Toward Longer Briefs
Raw frequency scaled by document length will prevent lengthy briefs from disproportionate influence on stop word identification, which produces more representative lists.
**Source:** FreeCodeCamp, custom stop word construction

### H13: Negation Words Must Be Preserved Despite High Frequency
Despite potentially high frequency, negation words ("not," "never," "no") carry critical sense in legal contexts and must be explicitly excluded from brief-specific stop word lists.
**Source:** BotPenguin, sentiment analysis considerations

### H14: Backward Filter Performance Validates Stop Word Candidates
Tests of whether candidate stopword removal improves or degrades classification performance (backward filter performance) provide empirical validation of stop word list quality.
**Source:** Springer, automatic extraction research

### H15: Legal Procedural Formulae Function as Domain-Specific Stop Words
Standard legal phrases like "respectfully submitted," "comes now," "whereas," "wherefore," "hereby," and "pursuant to" appear with high frequency across briefs but carry minimal case-specific discriminative information.
**Source:** Synthesis of legal domain sources

### H16: Citation Framework Elements Are Stop Words but Citation Content Is Not
Case citation structural elements and signal phrases ("see," "see also," "cf.") function as stop words, but case names and statute identifiers carry semantic sense and should be preserved.
**Source:** Expected brief-specific categories synthesis

### H17: Corpus-Level Analysis Generalizes Better Than Document-Level Analysis
Stop word lists derived from analysis of many briefs will generalize better to unseen briefs than lists derived from individual documents, which capture document-specific rather than domain-specific patterns.
**Source:** ISSI 2015 Proceedings

### H18: Combined Stopword Detection Methods Identify Unique Candidates
Each statistical method (TF, IDF, entropy, document frequency) detects unique stopwords, which underscores the merit of multiple approaches combined rather than reliance on a single measure.
**Source:** ArXiv (2024), Text Categorization

### H19: The Principle of Least Effort Explains Stop Word Existence
Humans repeatedly use familiar words for efficient communication, which naturally creates Zipfian distributions with a small set of high-frequency words (stop words) that dominate any corpus.
**Source:** GeeksforGeeks, Zipf's Law

### H20: Performance-Based Validation Requires Multiple Task Types
Validation of stop word lists requires tests of impact across multiple downstream tasks (classification, summarization, key phrase extraction) because optimal lists may vary by application.

## Meta-Analysis

### Key Themes Across Kernels

1. **Empirical Validation**: Strong emphasis on measured performance impact rather than theoretical correctness
2. **Hybrid Approaches**: Automated statistical methods combined with human expert validation
3. **Domain Specificity**: Generic solutions are insufficient; specialized domain knowledge is essential
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Conservative starts and expansion based on measured impact
5. **Multi-Method Convergence**: Multiple statistical measures used to identify robust candidates

### Knowledge Gaps Identified

1. Limited brief-specific empirical research (most legal NLP focuses on case law/statutes)
2. Insufficient knowledge of context-dependent stop word behavior in legal argument
3. Lack of quantitative data on corpus size requirements for reliable extraction
4. Unclear optimal update frequency for legal language that evolves
5. Limited research on multi-word legal phrase treatment as stop word units

### High-Confidence Kernels

**Most strongly supported facts:**
- F2: Domain-specific stop words improve performance (empirical 12-point improvement)
- F3: Legal lists are 10-15x larger than generic lists (3,602 vs 203 terms)
- F6: 85% document frequency threshold is effective (empirical validation)
- F9: Expert validation achieves high reliability (0.83 Cronbach's alpha)

**Most actionable hypotheses:**
- H2: Combined statistical + expert validation approach
- H11: Conservative start with iterative expansion
- H5: >85% document frequency as safe removal threshold
- H13: Preserve negation words despite frequency

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Validate H5 (85% threshold) empirically with brief corpus
2. Test H10 (5-10x size prediction) by creation of initial brief-specific list
3. Explore Q5 (context-aware methods) with transformer model experiments
4. Investigate Q6 (interaction with brief minification) through integrated tests
5. Address Q1 (optimal corpus size) through systematic sample experiments
