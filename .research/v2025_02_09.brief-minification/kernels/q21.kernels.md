**Source:** Cognetta et al. (2024). Tokenization Is More Than Compression. EMNLP 2024.

### Code-Switch Embed Homogeneity
After fine-tune on code-switched data, embed vectors became more scattered within the same region, which indicates higher homogeneity between English and Spanish embed vectors.
**Source:** Research on Code-Switch Multilingual Models (2024). arXiv:2503.07990.

### Unified Representational Space Development
Models develop unified representational spaces rather than maintain rigid language-specific clusters after code-switch train, which facilitates smoother semantic transitions between languages.
**Source:** Research on Code-Switch Multilingual Models (2024). arXiv:2503.07990.

## [SUMP] Kernels - Assumptions

### Statistical Redundancy vs. Semantic Criticality Assumption
The core tension is between statistical redundancy (which compression algorithms target) and semantic criticality (which domain experts require). What appears "redundant" from a statistical perspective often carries irreplaceable sense in specialized contexts.
**Source:** Executive Summary synthesis across 15+ sources.

### High-Entropy Token Semantic Importance
High-entropy tokens are assumed to correspond to pivotal semantic elements that determine the global reason trajectory, while low-entropy tokens are predominantly associated with local syntactic realizations.
**Source:** Research on Token Entropy (2024). arXiv:2512.23422.

### Domain Term Atomicity Assumption
Domain-specific terms should be treated as atomic semantic units rather than composed of unrelated subword parts.
**Source:** Inferred from Puccetti et al. (2024) fragmentation examples.

### Vocabulary Extension Size Trade-off Assumption
Every domain-specific token added to vocabulary increases model size, which creates inherent tension between compression (reduce model size) and semantic preservation (maintain domain vocabulary).
**Source:** Research on Vocabulary Customization (2024). arXiv:2509.26124.

### Hybrid Compression Strategy Assumption
Two-tier compression that treats domain terminology and general text differently is assumed to be more effective than uniform compression approaches.

**Source:** Wang et al. (2023) and Medical NLP challenges (2024).

### Multilingual Tokenization Parity Assumption
Different scripts or word structures (e.g., English vs. Mandarin) require subword methods like BPE to achieve comparable treatment across languages, which assumes that without this, words from different languages might be misrepresented.
**Source:** Milvus (2024). Code-switch NLP process challenges.

### Entropy Threshold Domain-Specificity
Medical and legal domains are assumed to require higher entropy thresholds for token preservation than general domains due to criticality of terminology.
**Source:** Inferred from synthesis of medical and legal domain research.

### Compression-Quality Inverse Relationship in Specialized Domains
Optimize for compression ratio is assumed to often degrade task performance in specialized domains, which suggests compete objectives.
**Source:** Cognetta et al. (2024). Tokenization Is More Than Compression.

### Model Size and Domain Knowledge Correlation
Larger models are assumed to have more embedded domain knowledge necessary for accurate terminology treatment, while lightweight models lack sufficient knowledge.

## [HYPO] Kernels - Hypotheses

### The Redundancy-Criticality Paradox
Domain-specific terminology and technical jargon appear statistically redundant (low frequency, high compression potential) while semantically critical (high entropy, irreplaceable sense). This paradox stems from the difference between statistical measurement and intrinsic information content.
**Source:** Core Insight synthesis from all sources.

### Entropy-Based Token Classification Hypothesis
Tokens can be reliably classified into semantic (high-entropy) and syntactic (low-entropy) categories, with semantic tokens that require preservation and syntactic tokens that allow aggressive compression.
**Source:** Research on Token Entropy (2024). arXiv:2512.23422.

### Hybrid Soft-Hard Prompt Efficacy
Hybrid soft-hard prompts that combine explicit preservation of critical details (numbers, names) with soft compression of context maintain domain-specific information better than pure soft or pure hard compression.
**Source:** Research on Information Preservation (2024). arXiv:2503.19114.

### Domain Vocabulary Coherence Through Intermediate Token Removal
Systematically remove intermediate tokens (partial words like 'entucky' or 'algorith') while preserve of domain terms improves vocabulary morphological coherence and interpretability.
**Source:** Research on BPE Vocabulary Refine (2024). arXiv:2409.04599.

### Compression-Semantic Preservation Decouple
Compression effectiveness and semantic preservation are decoupled objectives—optimize for one does not necessarily optimize for the other, particularly in specialized domains.

### Multi-Stage Compression with Checkpoints Superiority
Compress in stages with validation checkpoints to verify critical information retention outperforms single-pass aggressive compression.
**Source:** Synthesized from granularity research (Source 3) and LLMLingua methodology (Source 2).

### Domain-Adapted Tokenizer Universality
Domain-adapted tokenizers that treat technical terms as atomic units universally outperform general-purpose tokenizers for specialized text across all domains.
**Source:** Generalized from medical domain results (Puccetti et al. 2024).

### Entropy Threshold Adaptability
Optimal entropy thresholds for distinguish critical from redundant tokens vary by domain and can be determined empirically through downstream task performance measurement.
**Source:** Synthesized from entropy research and domain-specific performance data.

### Cross-Lingual Semantic Consistency via Unified Spaces
Models that develop unified representational spaces for code-switched content maintain better cross-lingual semantic consistency than models with rigid language-specific clusters.
**Source:** Research on Code-Switch Multilingual Models (2024). arXiv:2503.07990.

### Medical Terminology Oversimplification Risk
Aggressive simplification or compression of medical terminology risks semantic loss that could lead to medically-dangerous misinterpretation, which suggests conservative compression is warranted.
**Source:** Medical NLP challenges (2024) and Wang et al. (2023).

### Token Information Content Predictability
Technical vocabulary has high per-token information content despite low frequency because these terms cannot be predicted from context that surrounds them, which makes them resistant to efficient compression.
**Source:** Synthesized from Shannon entropy theory and empirical domain-specific results.

### Named Entity Compression Vulnerability
Named entities, numerical values, and domain-specific facts are disproportionately vulnerable to loss in compression compared to general contextual text.
**Source:** Research on Information Preservation (2024). arXiv:2503.19114.

### Morphological Boundary Preservation Principle
Tokenization that respects morphological boundaries preserves semantic content better than tokenization that splits words arbitrarily, particularly for technical terminology.
**Source:** Research on Word Split Impact (2024). arXiv:2402.14616.

### Code-Switch Resource Scarcity Impact
The lack of large-scale code-switch corpora for specialized domains creates systematic blind spots in compression algorithm development for multilingual technical content.
