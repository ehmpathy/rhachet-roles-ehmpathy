## [FACT] Kernels - Grounded, Provable, Empirically or Logically Verifiable Knowledge

### Instruction Hierarchy and Priority Levels

**[FACT]** Instruction hierarchy is a prioritized framework in AI systems that resolves conflicts among directives from diverse sources by designating higher-privilege instructions to override lower ones.
- Source: Ylang Labs, OpenReview

**[FACT]** Instruction priorities are structured as: Priority 0 (critical): System Message, Priority 10 (high): User Messages, Priority 20 (medium): Messages in images/audio, Priority 30 (low): Text from tools.
- Source: Ylang Labs, OpenReview

**[FACT]** System prompts take priority over user prompts in the instruction hierarchy - when there's conflict, the system prompt wins.
- Source: Ylang Labs, OpenReview

**[FACT]** Models trained with hierarchical instruction awareness demonstrate up to 63% better resistance to attacks while maintaining functionality.
- Source: OpenAI research via Ylang Labs

### Compression Performance and Ratios

**[FACT]** Microsoft's LLMLingua achieves around 20x compression while preserving the original prompt's capabilities, particularly for tasks involving in-context learning and reasoning.
- Source: Microsoft Research, ACL Anthology

**[FACT]** Compression approaches can achieve minimal performance loss or even improve performance with up to a 20x compression ratio.
- Source: Microsoft Research via Sand Garden

**[FACT]** Achieving high compression ratios like 99.3% can result in lower quality scores, and those lost details eventually require re-fetching, which can exceed the token savings.
- Source: Factory.ai

**[FACT]** AI prompt compression systems analyze the prompt to understand its structure and identify different components—instructions, examples, context information, and so on.
- Source: DataCamp, ScienceDirect

### Component Classification and Treatment

**[FACT]** Prompt components include instruction, persona (role), context, exemplar, format, tone, constraint, and technique.
- Source: LLMNanban, GPTBots

**[FACT]** In identity prompts, Role, Tasks, and Constraints are categorized as Required, while Persona and Goals are categorized as Optional.
- Source: GPTBots

**[FACT]** The Budget Controller dynamically allocates different compression ratios to various components of a prompt, such as instructions, demonstrations, and questions, recognizing that not all prompt components should be compressed equally.
- Source: DataCamp, ScienceDirect

**[FACT]** Crucial sections like instructions and questions are less compressed compared to potentially redundant demonstrations.
- Source: DataCamp, ScienceDirect

**[FACT]** LLMLingua performs coarse-grained, demonstration-level compression to maintain semantic integrity under high compression ratios.
- Source: Medium, Vanderbilt University

### Information Density and Semantic Compression

**[FACT]** GPT-4 can maintain semantic direction regardless of whether it can accurately capture the underlying text.
- Source: arXiv, Medium

**[FACT]** Telegraphic Semantic Compression (TSC) is a lossy semantic compression technique that removes predictable grammatical structure while preserving the high-entropy, fact-rich details that actually carry meaning.
- Source: Vanderbilt University

**[FACT]** The density and position of key information in a prompt affect the performance of downstream tasks.
- Source: Microsoft Research

**[FACT]** Models perform best when relevant information is toward the beginning or end of the input context.
- Source: IBM, Eval 16x

### System Prompt Architecture

**[FACT]** System prompts define the model's behavior, role, and constraints at the application level, enabling developers to maintain consistent AI behavior, implement security boundaries, and create sophisticated multi-turn conversations.
- Source: Surendran B, Medium

**[FACT]** Models treat system prompts as high-priority context that shapes the entire response generation process, while user prompts provide the specific task or query to be addressed within that framework.
- Source: Surendran B, Sahara AI

**[FACT]** The model reads the system message first and sets the 'Global State' of the neural network—priming it to behave a certain way—before it ever sees the user's input.
- Source: Medium

**[FACT]** Role prompting assigns the model a specific identity, expertise, or perspective to shape the scope of how it responds.
- Source: Infomineo, DigitalOcean

**[FACT]** Heavy-handed role assignments ('You are a world-renowned expert who never makes mistakes') may actually backfire by limiting helpfulness - a lighter touch often works better.
- Source: Infomineo, Lakera

### Context Window Management

**[FACT]** Essential information includes the core elements needed for the task, while optional (supplementary) content could be prior conversation history, extended metadata, or examples—things that are helpful but not essential.
- Source: IBM, Eval 16x, Agenta

**[FACT]** Optimizing for your specific task beats chasing bigger context windows - effective context management is more about strategic information placement and prioritization than simply having a larger window.
- Source: IBM

**[FACT]** Filtering techniques evaluate the information content of different parts of a prompt and remove redundant information at various levels such as sentences, phrases, or tokens, retaining only the most relevant parts.
- Source: PromptLayer, FreeCodeCamp

### Structured Preservation

**[FACT]** Structure forces preservation by dedicating sections to specific information types, which prevents the summarizer from silently dropping file paths or skipping over decisions, with each section acting as a checklist.
- Source: Factory.ai

**[FACT]** Some systems maintain a structured, persistent summary with explicit sections for different information types: session intent, file modifications, decisions made, and next steps.
- Source: Factory.ai

### Constraints and Guardrails

**[FACT]** Constraints reduce the risk of AI making inaccurate or inappropriate responses by defining limitations and rules that guide the agent's behavior, defining desirable and undesirable actions.
- Source: PromptHub, Medium

**[FACT]** Preventing unintended behaviors requires clear goal and scope definition, action constraints and permissions, autonomy boundaries and budgets, guardrails at the policy layer, human-in-the-loop controls, observability, logging and replay.
- Source: PromptHub, Scalefocus

**[FACT]** Vague instructions like 'respond politely' fail, while precise task instructions like 'generate a two-sentence apology email that references the customer's past issue' yield better results.
