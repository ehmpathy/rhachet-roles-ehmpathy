## Research Question
What is the theoretical compression limit for text reduction that preserves semantic content? Information-theoretic bounds on semantic compression (ref: arxiv 2306.02305)

## Executive Summary

This research explores the theoretical limits of semantic compression—text reduction that maintains semantic content rather than exact symbol reproduction. Current research establishes that semantic compression can approach **0.69-0.70 bits/character** for natural language with state-of-the-art language models, though theoretical bounds depend on task-specific semantic distance measures. The field extends classical Shannon information theory to incorporate semantic content, task-relevance, and Bayesian network structures that characterize compression limits. A critical result shows the existence of a **phase transition** at approximately α* ≈ 0.4049 relative embedded dimension, beyond which lossless semantic compression becomes impossible.
