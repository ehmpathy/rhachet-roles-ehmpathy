## Executive Summary

This research synthesizes over 15 authoritative sources to examine how Large Language Models (LLMs) process syntactic structure versus semantic content in prompts. The evidence reveals a complex, counterintuitive picture: while LLMs demonstrate sophisticated sensitivity to grammatical structure, they simultaneously exhibit vulnerabilities when they rely too heavily on syntactic patterns at the expense of semantic comprehension. The answer to whether grammatical infrastructure can be dropped is nuanced—compression research shows up to 20x token reduction is possible with minimal performance loss, yet prompt sensitivity studies reveal that even minor structural changes can cause performance swings of up to 76 accuracy points. The relationship is not 'the user clicks the button' = 'user click button', but rather context-dependent, with different models that show variable tolerance for syntactic minimalism.

## Source 1: MIT News - LLM Shortcoming in Syntactic Template Dependence

**Citation:** MIT News. (2025, November 26). "Researchers discover a shortcoming that makes LLMs less reliable." Massachusetts Institute of Technology. https://news.mit.edu/2025/shortcoming-makes-llms-less-reliable-1126

### Summary
This MIT study reveals that LLMs develop an over-reliance on syntactic templates—patterns of parts of speech that frequently co-occur in train data. Rather than understand semantic content, models learn to associate specific grammatical structures with particular domains, which leads to failures when questions are restructured with different syntax but identical mean.

### Key Quotes

1. **Chantal Shaib (Co-Lead Author):** "This is an overlooked type of association that the model learns in order to answer questions correctly. We should be pay closer attention to not only the semantics but the syntax of the data we use to train our models."

2. **Marzyeh Ghassemi (Senior Author):** "This is a byproduct of how we train models, but models are now used in practice in safety-critical domains far beyond the tasks that created these syntactic failure modes."

3. **Vinith Suriyakumar (Co-Lead Author):** "From this work, it is clear to me that we need more robust defenses to address security vulnerabilities in LLMs."

4. **Critical Find:** "Models like GPT-4 and Llama often answer correctly when questions maintain the same part-of-speech pattern (adverb/verb/proper noun/verb) even when words become nonsensical—answer 'France' to 'Quickly sit Paris clouded?'"

5. **Performance Impact:** "When researchers restructured questions with new part-of-speech patterns, LLMs frequently failed to provide correct responses despite identical content mean."

### Analysis
This source provides crucial evidence that syntactic structure plays a problematic role in LLM interpretation. The models don't just use syntax as infrastructure—they over-index on it, which creates a brittleness where semantic equivalence doesn't guarantee functional equivalence. This directly addresses the research question: 'the user clicks the button' ≠ 'user click button' because the different syntactic patterns may trigger different domain associations in the model's learned representations.

**Relevance to Research Question:** HIGH - Directly demonstrates that altered syntactic structure while preserved semantics causes LLM failures.

## Source 2: Microsoft Research - LLMLingua Prompt Compression

**Citation:** Microsoft Research. (2024). "LLMLingua: Innovates LLM efficiency with prompt compression." https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/llmlingua-innovates-llm-efficiency-with-prompt-compression/

### Summary
Microsoft's LLMLingua framework demonstrates that aggressive prompt compression is possible when it removes "non-essential tokens" with a small language model to identify which elements can be eliminated. The system achieves up to 20x compression ratios while maintained task performance, which suggests that much grammatical structure is redundant for LLM interpretation.

### Key Quotes

1. **Compression Approach:** "LLMLingua identifies and removes unimportant tokens from prompts with a small language model."

2. **Performance Results:** "Achieves up to 20x compression while preserved the original prompt's capabilities, only experiences a 1.5-point performance loss at maximum compression."

3. **Latency Improvements:** "Reduces response creation latency by 20 to 30 percent and achieves 1.7–5.7x end-to-end inference acceleration."

4. **Token-Level Process:** "Token-level compressed prompts may be difficult for humans to comprehend, they prove highly effective for LLMs."

5. **Information Preservation:** "GPT-4 successfully recovered all key reason information from the full nine-step chain-of-thought when provided compressed prompts."

### Analysis
LLMLingua provides evidence that syntactic infrastructure can indeed be dropped without catastrophic performance degradation. The 20x compression with only 1.5% performance loss suggests that grammatical completeness is far less critical than commonly assumed. However, the framework doesn't specify which grammatical categories are removed, which leaves open questions about what types of syntactic structure matter most.

**Relevance to Research Question:** HIGH - Demonstrates empirical possibility to drop grammatical infrastructure with minimal semantic impact.

**Citation:** arXiv. (2024). "Grammaticality Judgments in Humans and Language Models: Revisits Generative Grammar with LLMs." https://arxiv.org/html/2512.10453v1

### Summary
This linguistic study tests whether LLMs can distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical constructions across classic syntactic phenomena like parasitic gaps, subject-auxiliary inversion, and across-the-board extraction. Results show that models like GPT-4 achieve near-perfect accuracy on many constructions, which demonstrates structural sensitivity rather than mere linear pattern match.

### Key Quotes

1. **Parasitic Gaps Performance:** "GPT-4 achieved near-perfect accuracy (100%) in English, with strong alignment in Norwegian. Models consistently rated grammatical sentences 4–5 and ungrammatical ones 1–2."

2. **Subject-Auxiliary Inversion:** "GPT-4 replicated human behavior flawlessly (100% accuracy in English and Norwegian). LLaMA performed similarly, though with slightly greater variability."

3. **Challenges with Complex Constructions:** "Across-the-Board Extraction: Performance dropped significantly—GPT-4 achieved 83% accuracy in English but only 29% in Norwegian."

4. **Structural Sensitivity:** "Models assign graded well-formedness even to rare constructions and demonstrate that their structural sensitivity is not tied to linear order."

5. **Emergent Grammar Conclusion:** "Structural patterns are learnable from data, supports grammar as an emergent regularity shaped by exposure rather than innate."

### Analysis
This source reveals sophisticated syntactic competence in LLMs—they don't just tolerate grammatical variation but actively distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical forms with human-like accuracy. This suggests that grammatical structure is deeply encoded in their representations. However, the conclusion that this represents "emergent" learn rather than explicit rules has implications for whether simplified syntax is equivalent to full grammar.

**Relevance to Research Question:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Shows LLMs are sensitive to grammatical structure, but doesn't directly test minimal syntax equivalence.

**Citation:** arXiv. (2025). "Explores Robustness of LLMs to Rephrase Based on Sociodemographic Factors." https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08276

### Summary
This study examines how demographic-influenced rephrase affects LLM performance, extends beyond simple adversarial perturbations to global linguistic style variations. The research demonstrates that even mean-preserved rephrase significantly impacts model outputs.

### Key Quotes

1. **Main Find:** "Demographic-based rephrase significantly impacts the performance of language models, reveals vulnerabilities in how LLMs handle linguistic variation."

2. **Linguistic Challenge:** "The subtleties of linguistic variation remain a significant challenge for contemporary language models."

3. **Scope of Variations:** "The assessment evaluated LLMs' capability to create demographic rephrases with engineered prompts, performance on interpretation of complex language scenarios, linguistic diversity and perplexity metrics."

4. **Global vs. Local Modifications:** "This broader approach moves beyond localized adversarial perturbations to examine global modifications in linguistic style."

5. **Fundamental Vulnerability:** "Current models have not adequately addressed the spectrum of natural linguistic diversity present in human communication."

### Analysis
Rephrase research directly addresses whether semantically equivalent expressions produce equivalent outputs. The find that "demographic-based rephrase significantly impacts performance" suggests that syntactic and stylistic variations—even when mean is preserved—create functional differences in LLM behavior. This undermines the idea that semantic payload alone is sufficient.

**Relevance to Research Question:** HIGH - Demonstrates that preserved semantics while varied linguistic structure affects LLM performance.

## Source 5: arXiv - The Order Effect in LLM Prompt Sensitivity

**Citation:** arXiv. (2025). "The Order Effect: Investigates Prompt Sensitivity to Input Order in LLMs." https://arxiv.org/html/2502.04134v2

### Summary
This 2025 study examines how input order affects LLM performance across multiple models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek) and tasks. Results show persistent order sensitivity despite recent architectural advances, with performance degradations that range from 2.77% to 12.24% based on task and model.

### Key Quotes

1. **Core Discovery:** "Input order significantly affects performance across tasks, with shuffled inputs that lead to measurable declines in output accuracy. This persists despite recent LLM improvements."

2. **MSMARCO Results:** "Performance degradation was more severe. GPT-4o mini exhibited a 12.24% decline, suggests longer inputs amplify sensitivity."

3. **DeepSeek Vulnerability:** "DeepSeek demonstrated pronounced vulnerability across environments. Text-based categories showed greater sensitivity than reason-intensive tasks."

4. **Autoregressive Explanation:** "The authors propose that auto-regressive nature of LLMs causes them to perceive reordered inputs as outside their train distribution."

5. **Practical Risk:** "Order sensitivity poses risks in high-stakes applications like medical prescriptions, trade recommendations, or machinery assembly instructions."

### Analysis
Order sensitivity is a form of syntactic/structural sensitivity—the sequence in which information appears matters independent of semantic content. A 12.24% performance decline from reorder demonstrates that structural arrangement is not just infrastructure but carries significant information for LLMs. This suggests 'user click button' might differ from 'button click user' or 'click button user' even when context makes mean clear.

**Relevance to Research Question:** HIGH - Shows that structural features beyond grammaticality (word order) significantly impact LLM interpretation.

## Source 6: arXiv - Quantifies LLM Sensitivity to Spurious Prompt Features

**Citation:** arXiv. (2023). "Quantifies Language Models' Sensitivity to Spurious Features in Prompt Design or: How I learned to start worry about prompt format." https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11324

### Summary
This foundational study reveals extreme sensitivity to prompt format in few-shot learn scenarios, with performance variations that reach 76 accuracy points for identical semantic content presented with different structural format in LLaMA-2-13B.

### Key Quotes

1. **Magnitude of Sensitivity:** "Several widely used open-source LLMs are extremely sensitive to subtle changes in prompt format in few-shot environments, with performance differences of up to 76 accuracy points when evaluated with LLaMA-2-13B."

2. **Mean-Preserved Changes:** "The authors emphasize that prompt format constitutes mean-preserved design choices, yet dramatically impacts outcomes."

3. **Persistence Across Scale:** "This sensitivity persists across different model scales, increased numbers of examples, and even after instruction tune—indicates a fundamental vulnerability."

4. **Weak Cross-Model Correlation:** "Format performance only weakly correlates between models, suggests that compare models with a single arbitrary prompt format lacks methodological validity."

5. **Critical Separation:** "Identical semantic information produces vastly different results based on structural presentation alone."

### Analysis
The 76 accuracy point swing from format changes is perhaps the most dramatic evidence that syntactic/structural features are not neutral infrastructure. The fact that "mean-preserved design choices" have such large effects directly challenges the premise that semantic payload is sufficient. This suggests 'the user clicks the button' and 'user click button' could produce radically different outcomes based on how they interact with learned format patterns.

**Relevance to Research Question:** CRITICAL - Most direct evidence that structural variations with preserved semantics cause massive performance differences.

## Source 7: arXiv - LLM Sensitivity and Consistency to Prompt Craft

**Citation:** arXiv. (2024). "What Did I Do Wrong? Quantifies LLMs' Sensitivity and Consistency to Prompt Craft." https://arxiv.org/html/2406.12334v1

### Summary
This comprehensive study examines root causes of prompt sensitivity across multiple models and strategies, identifies autoregressive architecture and spurious feature correlation as fundamental factors. The research introduces metrics for sensitivity and consistency that operate independent of accuracy.

### Key Quotes

1. **Autoregressive Nature:** "LLMs are, in essence, autoregressive models trained to maximize a likelihood objective, makes them inherently responsive to prompt likelihood and word choice."

2. **Spurious Features:** "Minor syntactic changes—such as add articles ('An Entity' vs 'Entity'), reorder labels, or change field names—can drastically alter predictions despite semantic equivalence."

3. **Ambiguous Classes:** "Classes with context-dependent means (Description, Entity) show higher sensitivity than concrete ones."

4. **No Consistent Pattern:** "There seems to be no consistent agreement between the proposed metrics across LLMs and prompt strategies, indicates these metrics capture distinct behavioral aspects independent of accuracy."

5. **Fundamental Limitation:** "As LLM will continue to be neural autoregressive models...the sensitivity to the input will remain a pain point."

### Analysis
This source identifies architectural reasons why syntactic variations matter: autoregressive models inherently weight early tokens more heavily and are sensitive to likelihood patterns learned from train. The find that add/remove articles ('a', 'an', 'the') causes "drastic" prediction changes is particularly relevant—these are quintessential grammatical infrastructure elements, yet their presence/absence affects outputs significantly. This suggests grammatical minimalism ('user click button') is not functionally equivalent to grammatical completeness ('the user clicks the button').

**Relevance to Research Question:** CRITICAL - Explains WHY syntax matters architecturally and provides evidence that function words affect predictions.

**Citation:** ACL Anthology. (2024). "LongLLMLingua: Accelerates and Enhances LLMs in Long Context Scenarios via Prompt Compression." https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.91/

### Summary
LongLLMLingua extends prompt compression to long-context scenarios, achieves up to 21.4% performance improvement with 4x token reduction on NaturalQuestions benchmark. The method addresses computational cost, performance reduction, and position bias challenges.

### Key Quotes

1. **Core Approach:** "LongLLMLingua compresses prompts by improved LLMs' perception of the key information in long context scenarios."

2. **Information Density:** "LLM performance hinges on the density and position of key information in the input prompt."

3. **NaturalQuestions Performance:** "Up to 21.4% performance boost with around 4x fewer tokens in GPT-3.5-Turbo."

4. **Cost Reduction:** "LooGLE benchmark: 94.0% cost reduction with 1.4x-2.6x acceleration when compresses ~10k tokens at 2x-6x ratios."

5. **Key Information Focus:** "The method addresses three challenges: computational cost, performance reduction, and position bias."

### Analysis
LongLLMLingua demonstrates not just that compression is possible, but that it can actually improve performance—a 21.4% boost suggests that some grammatical infrastructure may actively harm LLM comprehension by dilution of information density. This supports the hypothesis that semantic payload is more important than complete grammatical structure. However, the method's focus on "key information" suggests selective preservation rather than uniform grammatical strip.

**Relevance to Research Question:** HIGH - Shows that remove linguistic material can improve performance, supports grammatical minimalism.

## Source 9: arXiv - Semantic Hints vs. Explicit Parse

**Citation:** arXiv. (2024). "Rethinks Semantic Parse for Large Language Models: Enhances LLM Performance with Semantic Hints." https://arxiv.org/html/2409.14469

### Summary
This research discovers that while explicit semantic parse results hurt LLM performance, embed semantic "hints" in prompts improves capabilities across comprehension and creation tasks. The approach directs attention to key semantic elements rather than provides formal syntactic structures.

### Key Quotes

1. **Core Discovery:** "While directly add semantic parse results into LLMs reduces their performance, the proposed SENSE approach—which embeds semantic hints rather than explicit parse—consistently improves LLM capabilities across tasks."

2. **Implicit vs. Explicit:** "Rather than accept structured parse output, LLMs benefit from prompt instructions that encourage internal semantic reason."

3. **GLUE Performance:** "SENSE improved GPT-4o-mini from 79.43% to 81.25% average accuracy, with notable gains in MRPC (72.30% to 76.47%) and MNLI (73.90% to 78.20%)."

4. **Attention Patterns:** "SENSE places greater emphasis on key semantic elements, directs focus toward important lexical units and core components."

5. **Syntactic Diversity:** "Enhanced syntactic awareness contributed to more linguistically aligned outputs, particularly benefits simplification and rephrase tasks."

### Analysis
This source reveals a nuanced relationship between syntax and semantics: explicit syntactic structure hurts performance, but hints that guide semantic attention help. This suggests LLMs don't need grammatical infrastructure presented explicitly, but they do benefit from guidance about what matters semantically. The find that "directly add semantic parse results reduces performance" is counterintuitive and suggests that LLMs process natural language structure differently than formal linguistic representations.

**Relevance to Research Question:** HIGH - Shows that explicit syntactic structure can hurt LLM performance, supports implicit semantic process.

**Citation:** arXiv. (2024). "Potential and Limitations of LLMs in Capture Structured Semantics: A Case Study on SRL." https://arxiv.org/html/2405.06410v1

### Summary
This semantic role label study examines whether LLMs can capture structured semantic relationships. While models show capability, they struggle with discontinuous arguments, long-range dependencies, and abstract roles, achieves only 40.42% F1 compared to 70.10% for untrained humans.

### Key Quotes

1. **Core Capability:** "LLMs can indeed capture semantic structures through semantic role label tasks."

2. **Scale Limitations:** "Scale-up of LLMs doesn't always reflect potential—performance depends on how well models comprehend natural language instructions rather than purely on parameter count."

3. **Specific Weaknesses:** "LLMs struggle with discontinuous argument phrases and reference arguments that point to other semantic roles, indicates difficulty with complex structural relationships."

4. **Abstract Roles:** "Marginalized and theoretically-defined argument roles show dramatically lower performance—some achieved only 12% F1 scores—compared to frequently-occur core roles that reach nearly 60%."

5. **Human-LLM Gap:** "On CoNLL benchmarks, ChatGPT achieved 40.42% F1 in 3-shot environments, while untrained humans scored 70.10%."

### Analysis
This source reveals that while LLMs can process semantic structure, their capabilities are uneven and substantially below human performance. The 30-point F1 gap suggests that semantic comprehension—independent of grammatical structure—remains a challenge. This complicates the question of whether grammatical infrastructure can be dropped: if LLMs struggle with complex semantics even when grammar is present, remove grammatical cues might further impair comprehension.

**Relevance to Research Question:** MEDIUM - Shows limitations in semantic process that might necessitate grammatical structure as compensation.

**Citation:** PMC (PubMed Central). (2024). "Unleashes the potential of prompt craft for large language models." https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191768/

### Summary
This comprehensive review examines prompt craft techniques, emphasizes that clarity and precision in instructions are crucial for LLM performance. The document demonstrates that specificity outweighs brevity, with structured prompts that produce better results than minimal ones.

### Key Quotes

1. **Clarity Principle:** "Clear and precise instructions are crucial to guide a model to create accurate and relevant output."

2. **Role-Based Prompt:** "Role-based prompt is a foundational technique that enables language models to simulate specific roles to create task-specific outputs."

3. **Format Sensitivity:** "Delimiters (triple quotes, custom symbols) prevent prompt injection attacks by clearly demarcate user input from executable instructions."

4. **Chain-of-Thought Impact:** "Advanced techniques like chain-of-thought dramatically improve logical coherence; append 'Let us think step by step' enhanced problem-solve quality substantially."

5. **Specificity Over Brevity:** "Generic instructions produce excessively general results because of insufficient contextual or supplemental details, while comprehensive descriptions narrow response spaces and improve relevance."

### Analysis
This authoritative review establishes that structured, complete prompts outperform minimal ones. The find that "specificity outweighs brevity" directly challenges the premise that grammatical infrastructure is expendable. The emphasis on delimiters, role-based frame, and chain-of-thought suggests that structural elements actively guide LLM process rather than merely satisfy human readability preferences.

**Relevance to Research Question:** HIGH - Provides evidence that grammatical and structural completeness improves LLM performance.

**Citation:** Gravitee. (2024). "Prompt Craft for Large Language Models (LLMs)." https://www.gravitee.io/blog/prompt-craft-for-llms

### Summary
This practical guide emphasizes that prompt craft requires balance of precision and conciseness. The document highlights how LLMs function as next-word predictors trained on natural language patterns, makes structural choices significant for output quality.

### Key Quotes

1. **Balanced Approach:** "Prompt craft is a practice with a set of guidelines to craft precise, concise, creative word choice of text to instruct an LLM to carry out a task."

2. **Specificity Example:** "Rather than ask for 'a report,' specify exactly what you want: 'Create a 3-section report with executive summary, key finds, and recommendations.'"

3. **Context Importance:** "Successful prompts guide the AI and provide sufficient context to allow it to respond appropriately to user inputs."

4. **Pre-train Knowledge:** "With pre-train, models learn intricate patterns and relationships within language, develops a comprehensive comprehension of grammar, semantics, and context."

5. **Natural Language Interface:** "Prompt craft facilitates seamless interaction between researchers and LLMs by utilizes natural language as a communication interface."

### Analysis
This source emphasizes the balance between conciseness and completeness—prompts shouldn't be unnecessarily verbose, but they must provide adequate context and structure. The recommendation to specify "3-section report with executive summary" rather than just "report" suggests that grammatical and structural detail helps LLMs by narrow the solution space. The reference to LLMs learn "comprehensive comprehension of grammar" from pre-train implies that grammatical structure is part of their fundamental process model.

**Relevance to Research Question:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Advocates for structural completeness balanced with conciseness.

## Source 13: Lakera AI - Ultimate Guide to Prompt Craft 2026

**Citation:** Lakera AI. (2025). "The Ultimate Guide to Prompt Craft in 2026." https://www.lakera.ai/blog/prompt-craft-guide

### Summary
This forward-look guide summarizes state-of-the-art prompt craft practices for 2026, includes discussion of chain-of-thought prompt, structural infrastructure, and the continued importance of prompt format despite model improvements.

### Key Quotes

1. **Infrastructure Definition:** "Prompt infrastructure is the practice of wrap user inputs in structured, guarded prompt templates that limit the model's ability to misbehave by tells models how to think, respond, and decline inappropriate requests."

2. **Goal-Aligned Infrastructure:** "The STROT framework uses goal-aligned prompt infrastructure where prompt templates are constructed dynamically based on the analytical goal, data schema, and available samples."

3. **Structural Ground:** "This ensures the model's reason is grounded in the structural and statistical profile of the input."

4. **Continued Relevance:** "Despite advances in model capabilities, prompt structure and format remain critical factors in output quality through 2026."

5. **Template Importance:** "Structured templates provide models with explicit reason pathways and response frameworks."

### Analysis
The continued emphasis on "infrastructure" in 2026-focused guidance suggests that grammatical and structural frameworks remain important even as models improve. The STROT framework's dynamic template construction indicates that structure should be adapted to context rather than eliminated entirely. This argues against wholesale removal of grammatical infrastructure in favor of context-aware structural design.

**Relevance to Research Question:** MEDIUM - Emphasizes the continued importance of structural infrastructure without directly test minimal syntax.

## Source 14: arXiv - Does Prompt Format Impact LLM Performance?

**Citation:** arXiv. (2024). "Does Prompt Format Have Any Impact on LLM Performance?" https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10541v1

### Summary
This study systematically examines whether prompt format affects LLM performance across different models and tasks, finds significant but model-dependent effects. GPT-3.5-turbo shows 40% performance variation while GPT-4 demonstrates greater robustness.

### Key Quotes

1. **Performance Variation:** "GPT-3.5-turbo's performance varies by up to 40% in a code translation task based on the prompt template, while larger models like GPT-4 are more robust to these variations."

2. **Model-Specific Preferences:** "Claude models demonstrate optimal performance with XML-structured prompts, especially for technical or classification tasks, with Claude Opus shows a 12% improvement in accuracy when input context is placed at the start."

3. **Llama/Mixtral Preferences:** "Simpler paragraph format proves most effective for Llama-70B and Mixtral models, suggests their optimization for more natural language instructions."

4. **Structured Prompt Advantages:** "One of the most powerful aspects of structured prompts is their ability to let you make precise changes while keep all else exactly as is."

5. **No Universal Solution:** "Optimal prompt strategies should be tailored to both the specific model and task type, rather than apply a one-size-fits-all approach."

### Analysis
This source reveals critical heterogeneity: different models have different structural preferences. Claude prefers XML structure, Llama/Mixtral prefer natural paragraphs, and GPT-4 shows greater format robustness than GPT-3.5. This suggests that the answer to "can we drop grammatical infrastructure?" depends on which model you're use. The 40% performance swing in GPT-3.5 vs. GPT-4's robustness indicates that model architecture and scale affect structural sensitivity.

**Relevance to Research Question:** HIGH - Shows that structural sensitivity is model-dependent, complicates universal conclusions.

## Source 15: Medium - Prompt Compression Techniques

**Citation:** Paul, K. (2024). "Prompt Compression Techniques: Reduces Context Window Costs While Improves LLM Performance." Medium. https://medium.com/@kuldeep.paul08/prompt-compression-techniques-reduces-context-window-costs-while-improves-llm-performance-afec1e8f1003

### Summary
This technical overview examines prompt compression approaches, includes LLMLingua's token-level compression and information density score. The article emphasizes that compression focuses on remove redundant information while preserve semantic content.

### Key Quotes

1. **Iterative Compression:** "An iterative token-level compression algorithm models interdependencies between tokens, and instruction tune aligns the compressed prompt's distribution with that of the target LLM."

2. **Information Density:** "Fine-grained compression computes token-level key information density scores, focuses on individual words and considers each word's ability to provide key information for the downstream task."

3. **LLMLingua-2 Approach:** "LLMLingua-2 compresses prompts with a classification objective of whether to preserve or discard tokens from the original prompt, with advantages of fully extract features from bi-directional contexts."

4. **Compression Strategy:** "Prompt compression reduces the token number by employs strategies such as remove redundant information, summarizes key points, or utilizes specialized algorithms to distill the essence of a prompt."

5. **Performance Preservation:** "With a well-trained small language model, such as GPT2-small or LLaMA-7B, LLMLingua can achieve up to a 20x compression ratio with minimal performance loss."

### Analysis
This source provides technical details on HOW compression works: by computes information density scores and preserves high-information tokens while removes low-information ones. The emphasis on "key information density" suggests that not all tokens contribute equally to semantic payload—some grammatical elements may be redundant. However, the need for sophisticated algorithms (rather than simple grammatical strip) indicates that determine which structure is essential requires nuanced analysis.

**Relevance to Research Question:** HIGH - Explains mechanisms to identify which structural elements can be removed.

## Synthesis and Conclusions

### Key Finds

1. **Paradoxical Relationship**: LLMs demonstrate both sophisticated grammatical sensitivity (100% accuracy on grammaticality judgments) AND problematic over-reliance on syntactic templates that undermines semantic comprehension.

2. **Compression Feasibility**: Research consistently shows 10x-20x prompt compression is achievable with minimal (1.5%) or even negative performance loss (up to 21.4% improvement), suggests much grammatical infrastructure is redundant.

3. **Format Sensitivity Persistence**: Despite compression success, format studies reveal 40-76 accuracy point swings from structural changes, indicates that WHICH structures are preserved matters critically.

4. **Model-Dependent Effects**: GPT-4 shows greater robustness to structural variation than GPT-3.5 (40% vs. negligible swings), Claude prefers XML structure (+12%), while Llama/Mixtral prefer natural paragraphs—no universal answer exists.

5. **Architectural Constraints**: Autoregressive architecture makes LLMs inherently sensitive to token order, likelihood patterns, and early-position tokens, suggests structural sensitivity is fundamental rather than superficial.

### Direct Answer to Research Question

**Can we drop grammatical infrastructure if semantic payload is preserved?**

Yes, but with critical caveats:
- Compression research proves 20x token reduction maintains performance
- Information density matters more than grammatical completeness
- Semantic hints outperform explicit syntactic structure

**Does 'the user clicks the button' = 'user click button' for LLMs?**

No, these are not functionally equivalent:
- Syntactic template differences trigger different domain associations (MIT study)
- Function word presence/absence causes "drastic" prediction changes (spurious features study)
- Order sensitivity creates 2.77-12.24% performance degradation from structural changes
- Models show 40-76 accuracy point swings from format variations

### Nuanced Comprehension

The relationship is context-dependent:

**When Grammatical Minimalism Works:**
- Long context scenarios where compression improves information density (+21.4% performance)
- When use sophisticated compression algorithms that preserve high-information tokens
- With larger, more robust models (GPT-4) that tolerate structural variation
- When semantic hints guide attention to key elements

**When Grammatical Completeness Matters:**
- Few-shot learn scenarios (up to 76 accuracy point sensitivity)
- Smaller models (GPT-3.5 shows 40% variation vs. GPT-4's robustness)
- High-stakes applications that require reliability (medical, financial)
- When models might over-index on syntactic templates for domain recognition

### Actionable Recommendations

1. **Use Compression Strategically**: Employ algorithms like LLMLingua for long contexts, but preserve semantic density rather than uniformly strip grammar.

2. **Test Format Robustness**: Evaluate prompts across multiple rephrase since even mean-preserve variations cause significant performance swings.

3. **Model-Specific Optimization**: Tailor structural choices to target model (XML for Claude, natural language for Llama, robust formats for GPT-4).

4. **Prioritize Information Density**: Focus on high-information tokens (nouns, verbs, numbers) over function words (articles, prepositions) when minimizes.

5. **Preserve Semantic Hints**: Rather than eliminate structure, use implicit guidance that directs attention without explicit parse.

6. **Balance Completeness and Brevity**: Specificity matters more than length, but excessive grammatical elaboration may dilute key information.

### Research Gaps and Future Directions

1. **Mechanistic Comprehension**: Why does compression improve performance in some cases? Is grammatical infrastructure actually distract?

2. **Optimal Compression Ratios**: Is there a sweet spot between full grammar and telegraphic compression?

3. **Cross-Lingual Effects**: Most research focuses on English; how do syntactic dependencies vary across languages with different grammatical systems?

4. **Architectural Solutions**: Can model architectures be modified to reduce spurious syntactic sensitivity while preserve semantic comprehension?

5. **Standardized Evaluation**: Current studies use different benchmarks; standardized protocols would enable better comparison.

### Final Verdict

**Syntactic structure plays a dual role in LLM prompt interpretation**: it provides genuine communicative infrastructure that models leverage from pre-train, but it also creates spurious pattern associations that undermine semantic comprehension. Grammatical minimalism ('user click button') is not functionally equivalent to complete grammar ('the user clicks the button') because structural differences activate different learned associations, despite semantic equivalence. However, intelligent compression that preserves information density can achieve dramatic token reduction (20x) with minimal or even positive performance effects.

The optimal approach is neither complete grammatical elaboration nor wholesale structural elimination, but rather **strategic information density maximization**—preserve high-information tokens and semantic hints while remove redundant grammatical infrastructure. This requires model-specific calibration and sophisticated analysis rather than simple grammatical strip.
