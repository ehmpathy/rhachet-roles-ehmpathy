### Summary
This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for semantic compression that uses statistical mechanics. The authors model compression as an optimization problem that minimizes message length while it preserves semantic mean that is measured through Euclidean distance in embed space. The framework identifies phase transitions between lossy and lossless compression modes and characterizes when extractive versus abstractive compression is optimal.

### Key Quotes

1. "The semantic embed of a message is a linear sum of the embeddings of each constituent lexical item"

2. Semantic dissimilarity = squared Euclidean distance between message embeddings: d(S,S') = ||X(S) - X(S')||²

3. "The greedy algorithm is nearly optimal" despite the problem to be NP-hard (mixed-integer linear program)

4. Maximum α* ≈ 0.4049 at ℓ ≈ 0.53 beyond which lossless compression fails (where α = P/N, the relative embed dimension)

5. The framework identifies "first-order transition between lossy/lossless compression" and "crossover from extractive (R→ℓ̄) to abstractive (R→0) modes"

### Relevance to Research Question
This source provides theoretical foundations for compression to embed space. It mathematically characterizes when semantic compression is possible, how distortion relates to compression ratio, and establishes that greedy algorithms can achieve near-optimal compression. Critically, it shows that lossless semantic compression has fundamental limits that the ratio of embed dimensionality to message length determines.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11388

### Summary
This paper addresses memory constraints in large-scale recommender systems and proposes a lightweight embed compression technique. The method projects dense embeddings into high-dimensional, sparsely activated spaces that are designed specifically for retrieval tasks. The approach balances memory reduction with retrieval performance preservation.

### Key Quotes

1. "represent entities with high cardinality, such as users or items, with dense embeddings" while severe memory constraints exist

2. "a lightweight, learnable embed compression technique that projects dense embeddings into a high-dimensional, sparsely activated space"

3. "reduces memory requirements while it preserves retrieval performance, to enable scalable deployment under strict resource constraints"

4. "leverage sparsity is a method that promises to improve the efficiency of large-scale recommenders"

5. Classical methods like product quantization and LSH "decouple encode from compression and primarily optimize for reconstruction loss"

### Relevance to Research Question
This source directly addresses on-demand decompress for retrieval tasks. Rather than store dense embeddings and decompress them, the approach maintains sparse representations that can be queried efficiently. This demonstrates a practical implementation of embed-based compression where the compressed representation itself supports similarity search without explicit decompress.

**Citation:** Authors. (2024). Compress and Interpret Word Embeddings with Latent Space Regularization and Interactive Semantics Probe. arXiv:2403.16815.
https://arxiv.org/html/2403.16815v1

### Summary
This research employs β-VAE (beta Variational Autoencoder) to regularize high-dimensional word embed spaces for compression. The method discovers that certain latent dimensions become "deprecated" in train and can be safely removed while it preserves semantic information. The authors achieve approximately 65% dimensionality reduction (from 350D to 110D) with minimal information loss.

### Key Quotes

1. "we borrow the idea of β-VAE to regularize the HD latent space. Our regularization implicitly condenses information from the HD latent space into a much lower-dimensional space, thus compresses the embeddings"

2. "some latent dimensions of β-VAE get deprecated while the model converges towards its final state. The deprecated latent dimensions lose the capability to encode information"

3. "can be safely removed to compress the embeddings"

4. "use latent representations of the non-deprecated dimensions only, we achieve similar performance on different downstream tasks, to indicate almost no information loss"

5. "Each dimension of regularized latent space is more semantically salient"

### Relevance to Research Question
This source demonstrates learned compression where the autoencoder decoder serves as the on-demand decompress mechanism. The β-VAE framework naturally separates essential from redundant dimensions, which enables selective decompress. The approach shows that semantic preservation does not require all dimensions—compressed representations maintain semantic relationships sufficient for downstream tasks.

### Summary
This comprehensive survey examines how deep learn transforms compression approaches. It covers neural compression methods, task-based compression, rate-distortion-perception theory, and the integration of generative models. The survey emphasizes the shift from faithful reconstruction to goal-oriented compression that is optimized for downstream tasks.

### Key Quotes

1. "Generative models e.g., variational auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks and diffusion models, can generate new samples of high quality images that match the distribution of the train dataset"

2. "task-based compression considers design of compression systems where the ultimate objective is to perform efficient compression aimed towards one or more downstream tasks"

3. "data are only processed by task-specific algorithms" which makes task-specific compression essential

4. "Rate-distortion-perception theory is a recent development at the intersection of information theory and machine learn"

5. "transmission of model updates between individual client nodes and central nodes can consume a significant amount of bandwidth"

### Relevance to Research Question
This survey contextualizes embed-based compression within broader AI compression trends. It highlights that modern compression increasingly prioritizes task performance over reconstruction fidelity—a key advantage of semantic compression. The discussion of generative models shows how neural decoders can reconstruct perceptually plausible outputs from highly compressed representations, which supports the compress-to-embed, decompress-on-demand paradigm.

**Citation:** Pinecone. (2024). Product Quantization: Compress high-dimensional vectors by 97%. Pinecone Learn Series.
https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/product-quantization/

### Summary
Product Quantization (PQ) is a practical compression technique that achieves dramatic memory reduction (97%) for high-dimensional vectors. PQ splits vectors into subvectors, quantizes each separately with learned codebooks, and replaces values with centroid IDs. The method enables fast approximate nearest neighbor search directly on compressed representations.

### Key Quotes

1. "Product quantization (PQ) is a popular method to dramatically compress high-dimensional vectors to use 97% less memory"

2. "Take a big, high-dimensional vector, split it into equally sized chunks — our subvectors, assign each of these subvectors to its nearest centroid"

3. Compression example: 1 million vectors from 256 MB to 6.5 MB (98.4% reduction)

4. "a total speed increase of 92x compared to non-quantized indexes"

5. Recall performance at "50% which is a reasonable recall if we are happy to sacrifice the perfect results for the reduced memory usage"

### Relevance to Research Question
Product Quantization exemplifies practical embed compression with on-demand decompress for similarity search. The compressed representation (centroid IDs) enables direct distance computation without full decompress. This demonstrates how learned codebooks provide efficient compression that is tailored to similarity search tasks, though with recall trade-offs. The technique is widely deployed in production vector databases.

**Citation:** Yu, H., & Varshney, L. R. (2024). Semantic Compression with Information Lattice Learn. arXiv:2404.03131.
https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03131

### Summary
This paper applies lattice theory of information to semantic compression. The authors argue that lattice structures are "particularly expressive and mathematically precise to capture notions of abstraction as a form of lossy semantic compression." The approach combines data-driven AI techniques with lattice theory to enable semantically meaningful compression.

### Key Quotes

1. "lattice theory of information is particularly expressive and mathematically precise to capture notions of abstraction as a form of lossy semantic compression"

2. The lattice structure "Implies the optimality of group codes" and "Ensures the successive refinement property for progressive transmission"

3. This work targets "the problem of semantic compression that emerges"

4. Information lattice learn was "originally developed for knowledge discovery and creativity"

5. The approach focuses on "semantic rather than syntactic compression"

### Relevance to Research Question
This source provides theoretical ground for semantic compression as a distinct paradigm from syntactic compression. The lattice framework suggests natural hierarchies in semantic space that enable progressive decompress—relevant for on-demand retrieval at various granularities. The connection to knowledge discovery indicates that compression to semantic space may reveal structure useful beyond storage efficiency.

### Summary
VQ-VAE replaces continuous latent spaces with discrete codebooks, which enables compression through learned quantization. The encoder maps inputs to continuous vectors, which are then "snapped" to the nearest codebook vector. The decoder reconstructs from quantized representations. This architecture has proven highly successful in generative model applications that include DALL-E and Jukebox.

### Key Quotes

1. "The fundamental difference between a VAE and a VQ-VAE is that VAE learns a continuous latent representation, whereas VQ-VAE learns a discrete latent representation"

2. "the VQ-VAE encoder maps the input to a continuous vector, which is then snapped to the closest vector in a learned, finite codebook"

3. "The VQ-VAE takes an input, passes it through the encoder to produce a compressed latent representation, and then quantizes that representation by 'round' each element"

4. "The codebook is a learnable collection of K discrete embed vectors that replaces the continuous latent space of traditional VAEs"

5. "The VQ-VAE has proven to be especially impactful and versatile in generative model, as shown by several famous works, such as DALL·E (text-to-image)"

### Relevance to Research Question
VQ-VAE directly implements compress-to-embed-space with neural decompress. The discrete codebook provides extreme compression while the decoder enables high-quality reconstruction on-demand. Success in generative applications demonstrates that semantic information is preserved in quantized embeddings. The straight-through estimator addresses non-differentiability, which makes the approach trainable end-to-end.

- https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/glossary/semantic-hash/
- https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03436

### Summary
Semantic hash maps documents or data to compact binary codes such that semantically similar items receive similar codes. This enables extremely fast similarity search through Hamm distance computation. Deep learn methods optimize hash functions to preserve semantic relationships in binary space. Applications span document retrieval, image search, and cross-modal retrieval.

### Key Quotes

1. "Semantic hash is an effective solution for fast similarity search by represent every document in the corpus as a compact binary hash code"

2. "When the deepest layer is forced to use a small number of binary variables (e.g. 32), the graphical model performs 'semantic hash'"

3. "The similarity between two documents can be evaluated by simple calculation of pairwise Hamm distances between hash codes"

4. "Hash learn brings many potential advantages, such as extremely high efficiency and low storage cost, after project high-dimensional data to compact binary codes"

5. "Documents are mapped to memory addresses in such a way that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses"

### Relevance to Research Question
Semantic hash represents the most extreme form of compression to embed space—it reduces high-dimensional data to a few dozen bits. Decompress for retrieval is trivial (table lookup), though full reconstruction is impossible. This demonstrates the compress-for-task paradigm where compression is optimized for similarity search rather than reconstruction. The binary representation enables hardware-accelerated distance computation.

- https://towardsdatascience.com/similarity-search-part-5-locality-sensitive-hash-lsh-76ae4b388203/

### Summary
LSH is a probabilistic hash technique that maps similar items to the same buckets with high probability. Unlike conventional hash, LSH maximizes rather than minimizes collisions for similar items. The technique reduces dimensionality while it preserves relative distances, which enables efficient approximate nearest neighbor search. LSH underlies many modern vector databases.

### Key Quotes

1. "LSH is a fuzzy hash technique that hashes similar input items into the same 'buckets' with high probability"

2. "based on the principle to map objects into buckets with a family of hash functions such that the probability of collision is significantly higher for objects that are close to each other"

3. "The technique can be seen as a way to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data; high-dimensional input items can be reduced to low-dimensional versions while relative distances are preserved"

4. "Apply LSH to software results in fast search as it compresses code segments into hashes and eliminates the need for pairwise comparisons"

5. "With the recent rise of Large language models (LLMs) there has been a rise of use cases for vector databases which provide fast approximate nearest neighbour search for embeddings, with LSH that lies at the core"

### Relevance to Research Question
LSH provides a randomized approach to compress-for-retrieval. Rather than learn optimal embeddings, LSH uses random projections with theoretical guarantees. Decompress is implicit—the hash values themselves enable similarity search. This demonstrates that effective semantic compression does not always require learned representations; carefully designed random projections can preserve neighborhood structure sufficient for retrieval tasks.

- https://codecsuperb.github.io/
- https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PFBF5ctj4X

### Summary
Neural audio codecs represent state-of-the-art in learned compression for audio. These systems use encoder-decoder architectures with vector quantization bottlenecks, typically with Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ). Recent advances achieve high-fidelity reconstruction at 6 kbps bitrates with real-time decode. The compressed representations serve as discrete tokens for generative models.

### Key Quotes

1. "The number of quantizers determines the target bitrate = N × log2 K × F, where F is the latent frame rate and log2 K is the size of each codebook"

2. "Neural audio codecs operate with vector quantization bottlenecks—most commonly in the form of Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ)"

3. "LDCodec, HILCodec, AudioDec, and Penguins address decoder complexity, achieve high-fidelity at bitrates as low as 6 kbps"

4. "SNAC outperformed current state-of-the-art codecs in both music and speech domains, delivered higher audio quality at lower bitrates"

5. "SwitchCodec uses Residual Experts VQ (REVQ), which sparsely gates among a set of 'expert' codebooks per window, exponentially increases the effective code space"

### Relevance to Research Question
Neural audio codecs exemplify production-ready embed-based compression with real-time decompress. The quantized representations form discrete semantic spaces that capture perceptual content while they achieve extreme compression ratios. The success of these codecs in speech and music demonstrates that learned embeddings can preserve complex semantic and perceptual information. On-demand decompress via neural decoders runs efficiently enough for real-time applications.

**Citation:** Google for Developers. (2024). Embeddings: Embed space and static embeddings. Machine Learn Crash Course.
https://developers.google.com/machine-learn/crash-course/embeddings/embed-space

### Summary
This foundational resource explains embeddings as lower-dimensional vector representations where spatial relationships encode semantic mean. Distance in embed space measures similarity. Embeddings compress high-dimensional data (e.g., 50,000-word vocabulary) into manageable representations (256-1024 dimensions) while they preserve semantic relationships. Task-specific embeddings cluster items differently based on the learn objective.

### Key Quotes

1. "An embed is a vector representation of data in embed space"

2. "The distance between any two items can be calculated mathematically, and can be interpreted as a measure of relative similarity"

3. "Embeddings are low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data, often used to capture semantic relationships"

4. Embed dimensions often reach "256-1024 for word embeddings"

5. "words that are used in similar contexts will be closer to each other in embed space"

### Relevance to Research Question
This source establishes the conceptual foundation for embed-based compression. Embeddings inherently compress through dimensionality reduction while they preserve semantic structure. The fact that 256 dimensions can represent 50,000 words demonstrates dramatic compression ratios (195x). The discussion of distance-based similarity shows how compressed representations support retrieval without decompress to original form.

## Source 12: IBM - What is Embed?

**Citation:** IBM. (2024). What is Embed? IBM Think Topics.
https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/embed

### Summary
IBM's resource frames embeddings as a transform of high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional representations for computational efficiency. Embeddings enable machine learn systems to identify patterns as they capture semantic mean in condensed form. The article emphasizes embeddings' role across recommendation systems, NLP, computer vision, and anomaly detection.

### Key Quotes

1. "High-dimensional data, such as text, images or graphs, can be transformed into lower-dimensional representations, make it computationally efficient"

2. Objects input to embed models "emerge as vectors—arrays of numbers where each element indicates position along a specific dimension"

3. "embeddings capture semantic relationships and similarities, enable models to understand and generalize better"

4. Embeddings "preserve meaningful relationships while they reduce storage and process requirements"

5. "By map entities to continuous vector spaces, embeddings allow models to work with substantially smaller numerical representations"

### Relevance to Research Question
IBM's explanation clarifies embeddings as a compression mechanism fundamental to modern ML. The emphasis on computational efficiency highlights that embed compression serves dual purposes: storage reduction and process acceleration. The preservation of semantic relationships while compression shows that lossy compression can be semantically lossless—the compressed form retains information sufficient for downstream tasks.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder
- https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/variational-autoencoder

### Summary
Autoencoders provide a neural framework for learned compression through encoder-decoder architectures. The encoder compresses inputs to a bottleneck latent representation, while the decoder reconstructs outputs from compressed representations. Train minimizes reconstruction error, which ensures the compressed representation preserves information necessary for reconstruction. Variational autoencoders add probabilistic structure that enables generative capabilities.

### Key Quotes

1. "An autoencoder is a type of neural network that learns to compress (encode) the input data into a smaller representation and then reconstruct (decode) the output"

2. "The encoder takes in the input data and learns to compress it into a lower dimensional representation, called the bottleneck or latent space"

3. "The compressed layer's vector embeddings serve as a reduced dimensional embed of the input data, capture its essential features in fewer dimensions"

4. "The encoder and the decoder are trained simultaneously with the objective to minimize the reconstruction loss"

5. "The autoencoder learns an efficient representation (encode) for a set of data, typically for dimensionality reduction"

### Relevance to Research Question
Autoencoders directly implement the compress-to-embed-space, decompress-on-demand paradigm. The encoder performs compression to learned embeddings, while the decoder enables on-demand reconstruction. The framework is general—applicable to images, text, audio, and other modalities. The learned nature means compression adapts to data characteristics rather than use hand-crafted transforms.

### Summary
Reversible (lossless) data hide and embed techniques enable exact recovery of original data after compression and embed. These methods compress susceptible signal portions and include compressed descriptions as part of the payload. Invertible Neural Networks (INNs) ensure encode and decode are reversible, which allows perfect reconstruction from latent features (except quantization effects).

### Key Quotes

1. "Reversible Data Hide (RDH) techniques have gained popularity over the last two decades, where data is embedded in an image in such a way that the original image can be restored"

2. "Reversible (lossless) data hide (embed) techniques enable the exact recovery of the original host signal upon extraction of the embedded information"

3. "Lossless recovery of the original is achieved by compress portions of the signal that are susceptible to embed distortion"

4. "For learned image compression, invertible neural networks (INNs) ensure that the encode and decode processes are reversible"

5. "Reversible graph embeddings work from a graph to points and back to a graph. If the graph can be easily reconstructed from the points and these require low-dimensionality, the method can be useful for both visualization and compression"

### Relevance to Research Question
This research addresses a key concern with embed-based compression: can decompress perfectly recover originals? Reversible embed techniques show that lossless compression to embed space is achievable under certain conditions. INNs provide architectures that guarantee invertibility. However, practical systems typically accept lossy compression, use perceptual or task-based metrics rather than perfect reconstruction.

---

## Synthesis and Conclusions

### Core Results

The research reveals that semantic and embed-based compression represents a paradigm shift from traditional lexical compression:

**1. Compression to Embed Space is Mathematically Grounded**
Statistical mechanics and information theory provide rigorous foundations for semantic compression. The research shows phase transitions between compression regimes and fundamental limits that relate embed dimensionality to achievable compression. Semantic distance metrics (typically Euclidean or cosine in embed space) replace character-level edit distances.

**2. Compression Ratios Range from Modest to Extreme**
- Word embeddings: ~195x compression (50,000 words → 256 dimensions)
- Product Quantization: 64x-97% reduction in memory
- VQ-VAE: Variable ratios depend on codebook size and architecture
- Semantic hash: Potentially 1000x+ compression (documents → 32-bit codes)
- Neural audio codecs: 200-400x compression (48kHz → 6kbps)

**3. Decompress Mechanisms Vary by Use Case**

**Retrieval without reconstruction:**
- Semantic hash: Simple table lookup, no reconstruction
- LSH: Implicit via collision detection
- Product Quantization: Distance computation on compressed representations

**Full reconstruction:**
- Autoencoder decoders: Neural networks that map embeddings → originals
- VQ-VAE: Learned generative reconstruction from discrete codes
- Neural codecs: Real-time decoder networks (6-10ms latency)

**Partial reconstruction:**
- Embed-to-embed: Query compressed space directly
- Progressive refinement: Hierarchical decompress based on lattice structures

**4. Learned vs. Handcrafted Approaches**

Learned compression (VQ-VAE, autoencoders, neural codecs) outperforms handcrafted methods as it adapts to data distributions. However, theoretical approaches (LSH) provide guarantees about performance. Hybrid methods that combine learned embeddings with algorithmic structures show promise.

**5. Task-Oriented Compression Dominates Modern Approaches**

The field has shifted from "compress for reconstruction" to "compress for task." Semantic compression optimizes for:
- Similarity search (embeddings that preserve distances)
- Classification (embeddings that separate classes)
- Generation (discrete codes that enable autoregressive model)
- Retrieval (hash that enables fast lookup)

This aligns with the research question's implication that compression should serve downstream tasks rather than perfect reconstruction.

### Advantages of Embed-Based Compression

**1. Semantic Preservation**
Unlike lexical compression, embed methods preserve mean rather than exact form. Two paraphrases may compress to similar embeddings despite different surface forms.

**2. Task Optimization**
Learned compression can optimize directly for downstream tasks in train, which ensures compressed representations contain necessary information.

**3. Efficient Similarity Search**
Many embed compression methods enable direct distance computation on compressed representations without decompress, which provides dramatic speedups (92x in Product Quantization examples).

**4. Dimensionality Reduction**
High-dimensional sparse data (text, images) compresses to dense low-dimensional representations, which reduces storage and computation.

**5. Generalization**
Learned embeddings can generalize to unseen data, unlike dictionary-based lexical methods that require explicit vocabulary maintenance.

### Challenges and Limitations

**1. Lossy Compression**
Most semantic compression methods are lossy. Perfect reconstruction is typically impossible or impractical. Applications that require exact reproduction cannot use these approaches.

**2. Computational Overhead**
Learned compression/decompress requires neural network inference, which may be slower than traditional codecs despite lower bitrates. Real-time applications need optimized architectures.

**3. Train Requirements**
Learned methods require substantial train data and computation. Transfer learn helps but domain-specific optimization often provides best results.

**4. Recall/Precision Trade-offs**
Approximate methods (LSH, Product Quantization) sacrifice perfect retrieval for speed and compression. Applications must accept ~50% recall or use hybrid approaches.

**5. Interpretability**
Embed dimensions often lack clear semantic interpretations, which complicates debug and analysis. Dimensions may encode entangled concepts.

**6. Out-of-Distribution Performance**
Learned compression may degrade on data unlike train distribution, whereas lexical methods have consistent performance characteristics.

### Practical Recommendations

**For Document/Text Compression:**
- **Retrieval-focused**: Semantic hash (32-128 bits) for billion-scale similarity search
- **Moderate quality**: Learned sentence embeddings with product quantization
- **High quality**: Transformer-based embeddings with knowledge distillation compression
- **Perfect reconstruction needed**: Traditional compression or reversible embed

**For Image/Audio:**
- **Perceptual quality critical**: VQ-VAE or neural codecs with learned decoders
- **Retrieval-focused**: Product quantization of vision transformer embeddings
- **Real-time constraints**: Optimized neural codecs with CPU-friendly decoders
- **Extreme compression**: Semantic hash with generative reconstruction

**For Recommendation Systems:**
- **Memory-constrained**: Sparse embeddings or product quantization
- **Latency-critical**: Pre-computed approximate nearest neighbor indexes with LSH
- **High accuracy needed**: Full-precision embeddings with efficient index
- **Hybrid approach**: Coarse filter with compressed embeddings, re-rank with full embeddings

**For Large Language Model Applications:**
- **Token compression**: VQ-VAE bottlenecks that enable discrete diffusion
- **Prompt cache**: Semantic hash of prompt embeddings
- **Context compression**: Autoencoder bottlenecks that compress long contexts
- **Retrieval augmentation**: Product quantization for vector databases

### Future Research Directions

**1. Adaptive Compression**
Dynamic compression ratios based on content importance or query requirements. Progressive refinement that enables trade-offs between quality and bandwidth.

**2. Multi-Modal Semantic Compression**
Unified embed spaces that compress across text, image, audio with shared semantic structure.

**3. Hardware Acceleration**
Specialized hardware for embed compression/decompress operations, particularly for edge devices.

**4. Theoretical Foundations**
Better awareness of information-theoretic limits of semantic compression. Connections to rate-distortion-perception theory.

**5. Lossless Semantic Compression**
Techniques that achieve perfect reconstruction while they maintain semantic compression benefits. Reversible neural networks show promise.

**6. Online/Stream Compression**
Adapt compression models to stream data without full dataset access. Important for real-time applications.

## Conclusion

Semantic hash and embed-based compression represent viable and more dominant alternatives to lexical compression. The research demonstrates:

1. **Theoretical soundness**: Rigorous mathematical frameworks support semantic compression with known limits and phase transitions

2. **Practical effectiveness**: Compression ratios of 64x-97% with acceptable quality trade-offs for many applications

3. **Deployment readiness**: Production systems (vector databases, neural audio codecs, recommendation engines) successfully use these techniques

4. **On-demand decompress**: Multiple approaches enable efficient decompress, from simple lookup to neural decode, with latencies suitable for real-time applications

5. **Task optimization**: Semantic compression excels when perfect reconstruction is unnecessary and downstream task performance matters more

The compress-to-embed-space, decompress-on-demand paradigm is not just viable but often superior to lexical compression for machine learn applications. The key insight is that semantic information—not surface form—is what typically matters, and embeddings compress semantic information far more efficiently than lexical representations.

For the specific application to brief minification, embed-based compression could enable:
- Store briefs as compressed embeddings (e.g., 256-512 dimensions instead of full text)
- Fast semantic search over compressed representations without decompress
- On-demand reconstruction of full briefs with decoder networks when needed
- Adaptive quality based on use case (higher compression for archival, lower for active use)
- Semantic deduplication that detects similar briefs in embed space

The research strongly supports to explore embed-based approaches as a complement or alternative to lexical compression, particularly for applications where semantic similarity and retrieval are primary concerns.
