# Research Report: LLMs as Compressors vs Decompressors

## Research Question
How do LLMs perform as compressors vs decompressors? Given that LLM training ≈ finding redundancy, can we exploit their internal models to guide compression?

---

## Executive Summary

This research reveals a fundamental equivalence between language modeling and data compression, grounded in Shannon's information theory. LLMs demonstrate exceptional compression capabilities, often surpassing traditional algorithms like gzip and domain-specific compressors. However, a critical asymmetry exists: LLMs excel at compression (prediction-based encoding) but struggle with perfect decompression (round-trip consistency). The research identifies multiple practical applications for exploiting LLM internal representations to guide compression, including KV cache optimization, learned compression codecs, and white-box knowledge distillation.

### Summary
This paper interprets LLM training through the lens of Kolmogorov complexity and two-part coding theory, revealing how models progressively learn patterns from syntactic structures to factual knowledge. The research explains scaling laws and hallucinations through compression theory.

### Key Quotes

1. **Core Theory:** "Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon information theory have long established that optimal prediction of a data sequence is intimately tied to the most efficient compression of that sequence, with a predictive model, particularly a large language model (LLM), viewed as a practical approximation of the Kolmogorov compressor of training data."

2. **Training as Compression:** "LLM training can be interpreted as constructing a two-part code for the training data, where the model adjusts its parameters to learn patterns and structural regularities for more efficient compression."

3. **Learning Hierarchy:** "A model of low complexity captures only the most prominent regularities in the data," progressing from syntactic patterns to increasingly rare knowledge elements.

4. **Pattern Learning Order:** "Optimal compressors first learn to compress frequently occurring syntactic patterns, then progressively acquire knowledge elements in order of their frequency."

5. **Redundancy Rates:** "The syntax model's redundancy decreases at rate O~(N⁻¹), while knowledge redundancy decreases more slowly at O~(Nᵅ⁻¹)."

6. **Hallucination Explanation:** "For a fixed model capacity, if a knowledge element appears with a frequency below a certain threshold, the model will choose not to learn it," even when encountering it repeatedly during training.

7. **Scaling Law Formula:** "Loss = O~(Cₖₙw/N¹⁻ᵅ + Cₛᵧₙ/N) + H," where power-law distributed knowledge produces observable scaling patterns consistent with real-world LLM behavior.

8. **Compression Mastery Indicator:** "By examining how efficiently data can be compressed (by minimizing perplexity, or equivalently coding redundancy), researchers clarify LLM learning behaviors: syntax models are learned first at a faster rate, and knowledge elements are acquired according to the order of their frequency."

### Analysis
This source directly addresses the "finding redundancy" aspect of the research question. It provides mathematical formalism showing that LLM training is fundamentally about identifying and exploiting redundancy patterns, first at the syntactic level and then at the semantic/knowledge level. The connection between compression efficiency and learning order offers practical insights for designing training curricula and predicting model capabilities.

- **URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06645
- **HTML Version:** https://arxiv.org/html/2407.06645v1

### Summary
This paper discovers an "entropy law" connecting LLM performance with data compression ratios and first-epoch training loss, providing early indicators of model quality and data quality.

### Key Quotes

1. **Core Finding:** "Model performance is negatively correlated to the compression ratio of training data, which usually yields a lower training loss."

2. **Data Quality:** "Data is the cornerstone of large language models (LLMs), but not all data is useful for model learning."

3. **Information Redundancy:** "An 'entropy law' connects LLM performance with data compression ratio and first-epoch training loss, reflecting information redundancy and knowledge mastery respectively."

4. **Practical Method:** "The ZIP data selection method aims to prioritize data subsets exhibiting a low compression ratio using a multi-stage greedy algorithm focused on diversity."

5. **Early Detection:** "The entropy law can detect potential performance risks at the beginning of model training," offering early warning capabilities during the initial training phase.

6. **Combinatorial Effects:** "Most methods concentrate on evaluating the quality of individual samples in data selection, while the combinatorial effects among samples are neglected."

### Analysis
This source demonstrates how compression metrics can guide not just model deployment but also training data selection. The entropy law provides a practical tool for exploiting compression understanding to improve LLM quality before significant compute is expended. This directly addresses the research question's focus on exploiting internal models, showing that compression ratios predict model performance.

### Analysis
This source provides a practical framework for exploiting the compression-modeling equivalence. By showing that compression ratios can evaluate LLMs without task-specific benchmarks, it demonstrates how understanding LLMs as compressors enables new evaluation methodologies. The ability to compute compression ratios from negative log-likelihoods without actual encoding is particularly valuable for practical applications.

**Citation:** "An elegant equivalence between LLMs and data compression." Learn and Burn AI, 2024.
- **URL:** https://learnandburn.ai/p/an-elegant-equivalence-between-llms

### Summary
This article provides an accessible explanation of the theoretical foundations connecting LLMs to compression, focusing on Shannon's source coding theorem and arithmetic coding implementation.

### Key Quotes

1. **Shannon Foundation:** "Any compression method has a fundamental limit based on what's called the entropy of the data set," referencing Claude Shannon's 1948 source coding theorem.

2. **Prediction-Compression Link:** "LLMs are trained to output the probabilities of all possible next tokens based on the preceding tokens. This probability information enables arithmetic coding."

3. **Accuracy Matters:** "More accurate probabilities of the next symbol will allow the arithmetic coder to compress the data to a smaller size."

4. **Performance Results - Text:** "Chinchilla 70b achieved 8.3% compression (vs. gzip at 32.3%)."

5. **Performance Results - Images:** "48.0% (compared to PNG's 58.5%)."

8. **Cross-Domain Power:** "The model trained solely on text outperformed purpose-built compressors for other media types."

### Analysis
This source clarifies the mechanism by which LLMs function as compressors: their probability distributions over next tokens provide exactly the information needed for arithmetic coding. The cross-domain success reinforces that LLM internal representations capture fundamental patterns beyond surface-level text statistics, addressing the question of exploiting internal models.

**Citation:** "Can LLMs Compress (and Decompress)? Evaluating Code Understanding and Execution via Invertibility." arXiv preprint arXiv:2601.13398, 2025.
- **URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13398

### Summary
This paper reveals a critical asymmetry: while LLMs perform well at compression-like tasks, they struggle with true invertibility and round-trip consistency, indicating limitations in their internal coherence.

### Key Quotes

1. **Main Finding:** "Current LLMs struggle with true round-trip consistency, which demonstrates that they lack the internal coherence required for trustworthy code reasoning."

2. **Invertibility Problem:** "Testing whether models can maintain a consistent one-to-one mapping between encoding and decoding operations" reveals critical limitations.

3. **Performance Gap:** "Despite various approaches—zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning on execution traces, and self-reflection mechanisms—each yields modest improvements, but none closes the gap."

4. **Fundamental Issue:** "LLMs demonstrate strong performance on code benchmarks, yet fail when required to maintain logical consistency across forward and backward operations."

5. **Decompression Challenge:** The emphasis on "round-trip" evaluation indicates bidirectional inconsistency, showing asymmetry between compression (forward prediction) and decompression (inverse reconstruction).

### Analysis
This source directly addresses the "compressors vs decompressors" aspect of the research question. It reveals that LLMs are fundamentally asymmetric: excellent at compression-direction tasks (predicting/encoding) but poor at decompression-direction tasks (inverting/decoding). This has profound implications for applications requiring perfect reconstruction and suggests that while LLM internal models can guide compression, they may not reliably guide decompression without additional mechanisms.

- **URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06297
- **HTML Version:** https://arxiv.org/html/2505.06297v1

### Summary
This recent work demonstrates exceptional compression of LLM-generated text using next-token prediction, achieving compression ratios exceeding 20x and significantly outperforming traditional methods.

### Key Quotes

1. **Performance:** "LLM-based prediction methods achieve exceptional compression rates, exceeding 20×, which significantly outperforms the 3x achieved by gzip."

2. **Framework:** "The framework consists of context-based prediction and entropy coding, where context-based prediction estimates the probability distribution of symbols, and accurate probability estimation affords efficient entropy coding."

3. **Practical Application:** "Models like Llama 2 and Chinchilla are used as predictive models with arithmetic coding to obtain lossless compressors."

4. **State-of-the-Art:** "LLM-based compression (LM-GC) surpasses state-of-the-art lossless compression methods, improving compression rates by 10% up to 17.2% across various datasets and architectures."

5. **Modern Performance:** "Offline model-driven compression using modern models such as Llama 2 or Chinchilla with arithmetic coding can deliver significant improvement over state-of-the-art lossless compression algorithms across domains including text and vision."

6. **Critical Challenge:** "A significant challenge called prediction mismatch arises when compressed data is transmitted between encoder and decoder on different machines, as arithmetic coding requires the decoder to produce exactly the same probability distribution—which is unexpectedly difficult with modern machine learning models due to LLM non-determinism."

### Analysis
This source demonstrates state-of-the-art exploitation of LLM internal models for compression. The 20x compression ratio for LLM-generated text shows that models can efficiently compress their own outputs. However, the prediction mismatch problem reveals a key challenge in the compressor/decompressor asymmetry: LLMs must produce identical probability distributions on different machines, which is difficult due to floating-point arithmetic and implementation variations.

### Summary
This research explicitly addresses asymmetric encoder-decoder design in neural compression systems, acknowledging that practical deployments require different computational budgets for compression and decompression.

### Key Quotes

1. **Asymmetric Design Principle:** "Practical scenarios demand an asymmetric design, where the decoder requires low complexity to cater to diverse low-end devices, while the encoder can accommodate higher complexity to improve coding performance."

2. **Computation Offloading:** "Computation load can be effectively offloaded to the encoding side in learned image compression systems."

3. **Arithmetic Coding Complexity:** "Arithmetic coding is complex to implement due to its reparametrization. Additionally, one key issue of arithmetic encoding is to predict the probability of the current coding symbol from its context, i.e., the preceding encoded symbols."

**Citation:** Apple Machine Learning Research. "Compressing LLMs: The Truth is Rarely Pure and Never Simple."
- **URL:** https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/compressing-llms

### Summary
Apple's research examines practical challenges in LLM compression, including recovery fine-tuning effectiveness and the relationship between compression ratios and performance preservation.

### Key Quotes

- **URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07451
- **PDF:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07451

### Summary
This paper proposes compression methods that explicitly target redundancy in neural networks through joint sparsity promotion and redundancy minimization during training.

### Key Quotes

3. **Pruning Philosophy:** "Pruning removes entire filters or neurons that make little or no contribution to the output of a trained network, making a network smaller and faster."

4. **Redundancy Scale:** "Studies have demonstrated large redundancy (up to 400x) in the neural network size used for popular reinforcement learning tasks."

5. **Quantization Benefits:** "Quantization compresses the original network by reducing the number of bits required to represent each weight (for example, to 16-bit, 8-bit, 4-bit and even 1-bit)."

6. **Parameter Identification:** "In deep neural networks, many parameters are redundant because they do not contribute much during training, so after training, such parameters can be removed from the network with little effect on accuracy."

- **Related URLs:**
  - https://arxiv.org/html/2509.00579v1 (KVComp)
  - https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14051v3 (RocketKV)

### Summary
Dynamic Memory Compression represents a family of methods that compress LLM key-value caches during inference, learning to apply different compression ratios adaptively across layers and attention heads.

### Key Quotes

1. **Adaptive Compression:** "Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC) is a method for online key-value cache compression at inference time, with the model learning to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers."

2. **Performance Preservation:** "DMC preserves original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression, and can achieve up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference."

3. **Layer-Specific Strategies:** "The model learning to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers" demonstrates learned exploitation of internal structure.

4. **Soft Prompt Compression:** "Soft prompt methods allow compression of long contexts, generalization to unseen prompts, and higher compression ratios (up to 480x), often creating a new 'synthetic language' for the LLM."

5. **Extreme Compression:** "Up to 480x" compression ratios demonstrate the potential of exploiting learned representations, though at the cost of creating representations not human-interpretable.

6. **Memory Bottleneck:** "With the rapid advancement of LLMs, context length for inference has been continuously increasing, leading to exponential growth in KV caching demand and creating a significant memory bottleneck."

### Analysis
DMC and related methods represent sophisticated exploitation of LLM internal models for compression. By learning which attention heads and layers can tolerate more compression, these methods demonstrate that not all internal representations are equally important, and this structure can guide compression decisions. The soft prompt compression's creation of "synthetic languages" shows LLMs can learn highly compressed representations that preserve semantic content while being orders of magnitude smaller.

## Synthesis and Conclusions

### 1. Theoretical Foundation: LLMs as Compressors

The research establishes beyond doubt that **language modeling and compression are mathematically equivalent**:

- **Shannon's source coding theorem** provides the theoretical foundation: minimizing cross-entropy loss equals minimizing expected code length under arithmetic coding
- **LLM training objective** (maximizing log-likelihood) is identical to **compression objective** (minimizing description length)
- This equivalence is not metaphorical but fundamental: LLMs literally implement near-optimal compressors through their probability distributions

**Key Insight:** Training an LLM to predict next tokens IS training it to compress data. The model parameters represent a learned compression codebook.

### 2. LLMs Excel as Compressors (Forward Direction)

The empirical evidence shows LLMs are exceptional compressors:

**Performance Metrics:**
- Text: 8.3% compression ratio (vs gzip 32.3%) - 4x better
- LLM-generated text: >20x compression (vs gzip 3x) - 7x better
- Cross-domain: Text-trained models beat domain-specific compressors (PNG, FLAC) on images and audio

**Why They Excel:**
1. **Learned redundancy**: Training identifies hierarchical patterns from syntax to semantics
2. **Context modeling**: Long-range dependencies enable better prediction
3. **Universal representations**: Internal models capture fundamental patterns beyond surface statistics
4. **Adaptive compression**: Different patterns receive different coding lengths based on probability

### 3. Critical Asymmetry: Compression vs Decompression

Despite exceptional compression performance, **LLMs demonstrate fundamental limitations as decompressors**:

**Compression (Forward) Strengths:**
- Excellent prediction accuracy
- Efficient encoding through arithmetic coding
- Can handle diverse domains
- Scales with model size

**Decompression (Inverse) Weaknesses:**
- Poor invertibility and round-trip consistency
- Cannot reliably reverse their own operations
- Struggle with exact reconstruction
- Non-determinism creates prediction mismatch across machines

**Practical Manifestation:**
- KV cache must decompress entire context at each step while compressing only one token
- Decompression becomes the bottleneck: inference is decompression-bound
- Asymmetric architectures needed: complex encoders, lightweight decoders

**Fundamental Cause:**
LLMs are trained for prediction (compression direction) not inversion. Their internal representations optimize for forward probability estimation, not bidirectional consistency.

### 4. Exploiting Internal Models for Compression: Proven Strategies

Research demonstrates multiple successful approaches to exploit LLM internal representations:

**A. White-Box Knowledge Distillation**
- Access to intermediate representations enables better compression
- Student models learn teacher's internal structure, not just outputs
- Achieves better performance than black-box methods

**B. KV Cache Compression**
- Layer-specific and head-specific compression ratios (4-10x)
- Learned adaptive strategies: model learns which representations tolerate compression
- Exploits discovered redundancy structure in attention patterns

**C. Soft Prompt Compression**
- Extreme ratios (480x) through learned "synthetic languages"
- LLM internal models create compressed representations preserving semantics
- Demonstrates models can learn to operate on compressed inputs

**D. Compression-Guided Training**
- Entropy law enables data selection via compression ratios
- Training on low-redundancy data improves performance
- Compression metrics predict model quality before extensive training

**E. Quantization and Pruning**
- 16x compression (4-bit quantization + 50% sparsity) with minimal accuracy loss
- Removes redundant parameters identified during training
- Up to 400x redundancy found in trained networks

### 5. Redundancy Discovery During Training

The research validates that **LLM training ≈ finding redundancy**:

**Learning Hierarchy:**
1. **First**: Syntactic patterns (high frequency, simple) - O(N⁻¹) redundancy reduction
2. **Second**: Semantic patterns (medium frequency, complex) - slower reduction
3. **Last**: Rare knowledge (low frequency) - O(Nᵅ⁻¹) reduction where α < 1

**Compression-Theory Explanation:**
- Model adjusts parameters to minimize description length (two-part code)
- Frequently occurring patterns get shorter codes
- Rare patterns may not be learned (hallucinations) if below capacity threshold
- Scaling laws emerge naturally from power-law knowledge distributions

**Practical Implication:**
Monitoring compression ratios during training provides insights into:
- What the model has learned
- When it will learn specific knowledge types
- Potential performance risks early in training

### 6. Actionable Recommendations

Based on this research synthesis, here are concrete ways to exploit LLM internal models for compression:

**For Data Compression Applications:**
1. **Use LLMs as compressors** for data matching their training distribution (20x+ ratios possible)
2. **Pair with arithmetic coding** to convert predictions into compressed bitstreams
3. **Address non-determinism** through careful implementation for cross-machine consistency
4. **Accept asymmetry**: Invest in encoder complexity, optimize decoder for speed
5. **Consider ANS encoding** for 50% faster decoding than Huffman

**For Model Compression:**
1. **Apply white-box distillation** accessing intermediate representations
2. **Use compression metrics** (perplexity, description length) to evaluate compressed models
3. **Implement adaptive KV cache compression** with layer-specific strategies
4. **Combine techniques**: quantization + pruning + distillation for 16x+ compression
5. **Use recovery fine-tuning** to regain 27% performance (from 57% to 84% retention)

**For Training Optimization:**
1. **Monitor compression ratios** during training as learning indicators
2. **Select training data** with low compression ratios (high information density)
3. **Predict scaling behavior** using compression-based scaling laws
4. **Design curricula** following syntax→semantics→knowledge hierarchy

**For Inference Optimization:**
1. **Compress KV cache** (4-10x) with negligible quality loss
2. **Use soft prompts** for extreme context compression (up to 480x)
3. **Optimize for decompression** not compression - inference is decompression-bound
4. **Accept quality-speed trade-offs**: 90% compression gives 60% faster inference

### 7. Open Challenges and Future Directions

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **Invertibility Problem**: How to make LLMs reliable decompressors?
2. **Cross-Machine Consistency**: Solving prediction mismatch in distributed compression
3. **Semantic Decompression**: Recovering exact representations from compressed internal states
4. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining LLM compression with traditional algorithms

**Promising Directions:**
1. **Training for bidirectionality**: Explicitly train for round-trip consistency
2. **Learned entropy coders**: Replace arithmetic coding with neural methods
3. **Compression-aware architectures**: Design models specifically for compression/decompression tasks
4. **Multi-scale compression**: Exploit hierarchical redundancy at different levels

### 8. Final Answer to Research Question

**How do LLMs perform as compressors vs decompressors?**

LLMs perform **exceptionally as compressors** (achieving 4-20x better ratios than traditional methods) but **poorly as decompressors** (lacking invertibility and round-trip consistency). This asymmetry is fundamental to their architecture and training objective, which optimizes for forward prediction not bidirectional consistency.

**Can we exploit their internal models to guide compression?**

**Yes, extensively and successfully.** Research demonstrates multiple proven strategies:
- White-box distillation exploiting intermediate representations (16x compression)
- KV cache compression using learned layer-specific strategies (4-10x compression)
- Soft prompt compression creating synthetic languages (480x compression)
- Compression-guided training data selection (entropy law)
- Quantization and pruning of redundant parameters (up to 400x redundancy)

The key is recognizing that **LLM training IS redundancy finding**, and the learned internal models encode this redundancy structure. By accessing these internal representations (white-box) rather than just inputs/outputs (black-box), we can achieve dramatically better compression while maintaining performance.

**Practical Takeaway:**

The compression lens provides profound insights into LLM capabilities and limitations. Understanding LLMs as compressors explains their strengths (pattern recognition, generalization), weaknesses (hallucinations, inference costs), and provides concrete optimization strategies (KV compression, distillation, data selection). The field has moved beyond theoretical equivalence to practical exploitation of this understanding.
